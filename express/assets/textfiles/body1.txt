"I'm currently a young university student living in Canada who's interest has been greatly peaked by Anime. I always watched stuff like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z growing up (even had a few nightmares caused by Neon Genesis Evangelion), but as I got older I drifted from the medium until I reconnected with it in highschool and when it flourished in university."
