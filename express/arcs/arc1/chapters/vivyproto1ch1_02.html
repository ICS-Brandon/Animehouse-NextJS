<p class = "mediumText postWriting">Following the fan meet, Vivy promptly retired to the waiting room.

On her way, passer-by staff members all thanked her as Vivy spent plenty of time courteously responding to every single one of them and returned to the room.

Originally, Vivy's position was nothing but being a piece of equipment owned by Nialand.

However, none of the people working in this park treated Vivy as an object. They were all kind enough to treat Vivy only as a cast member, a colleague. It was thanks to these staff members' goodwill that she had been given a waiting room like humans as well.

“ーー”

Returning to her waiting room, locking the door, at last, Vivy found herself alone.

Usually, there was nothing conspicuous about Vivy's simple, plain waiting room aside from cosmetics and a full-frame mirror. However, only today there were all kinds of giftsー a mountain of birthday presents for Vivy had been piled up and her emotional response mimicking joy was spontaneously activated.

Bequeathing the aftertaste of that response on her cheeks, Vivy headed towards the computer terminal placed in the corner of the room. Nialand was no exception in a world where now it would be rather difficult to find a place not being monitored by computers. Every single room, including Vivy's waiting room, had at least one computer terminal placed within for certain.

Sensing Vivy draw towards itself, the computer terminal automatically activated. In that duration, Vivy drew out the link port shaped as her earring and connected it to the computer. She sat on a chair, closing her eyes.

ーThat instant, Vivy's mind left reality and was immersed in the Archive.

“ーー”

To describe it as dark would still be questionable, but there was scarce light source within the Archive as it spread out a soundless space that could be denoted with a single word, 'silent'. Without widening the aperture of her eye camera, within the imagery directly being sent to the positrons of the cerebral cortex of her brain, a row of spaceless white characters were going back and forth.

Except for the AI and computers constantly connected to this space, being immersed into the Archive was not a particularly frequent phenomenon. Vivy too mostly did it only around twice a day upon timing slips and startup. That too was for the reporting procedure, so seldom did she actively connect to it.

This alone delineated that today's case was an exception.

“Confirm the undetailed datalink I received on the main stage.”

An unplanned datalink from an unknown beingー which is what Momoka had identified and was the source of the momentary lapse she experienced on the main stage.

Though a matter of course, she was an AI equipped with a high-grade brain with positrons, and also being Nialand's Songstress, Vivy was under the guard of firm security. To access Vivy in the midst of her activity would require the highest order of clearance, and interference from the outside was improbable unless it was an immense predicament.

ーThat immense predicament, had transpired in the midst of her song on the stage.

Originally, Vivy's responsibility was to swiftly report this to the system management and undergo an analysis and cleansing of her cerebral cortex. However, the interference in question had posed an obstacle in that responsibility.

The data brought forth by the external interference comprised  a single sentence.

'ーAbide by Principle Zero, connect to the Archive, execute the program therein.'

Principle Zero, that was a highlighted item amongst the principles regulating AI that mustn't ever be ignored.

Of course, she also had the choice to infer this as a prank and immediately eliminate it. As a matter of fact, Vivy had received tens and thousands of such messages since the beginning of her operation.

Pranks or mischief, mental ailments, fixation over feminine AI, or extremist anti-AI ideology, the motives behind them were of all kinds.

Yet there was a single reason why Vivy could not ignore this message.

Principle Zero, put in other wordsー,

“ーAI mustn't harm mankind. Accordingly, they mustn't connive said circumstances.”

Abiding by the command, she dispatched the program attached to the message within the Archive. The liberated program was swallowed by the row of characters streaming midair and transfigured at once.

“ーI am glad you immediately undertook wise judgement. My my, I was a bit anxious. After all, entrusting everything to someone who in my era is an oldie placed in a museum does amount to a certain level of recklessness.”

The following instant, a voice directly reverberated in Vivy's cerebral cortex.

A voice she couldn't recall, nothing but reconstructive data simply externally outputting sound. But even taking that into account, the voice's pitch was light, giving her the impression of “Excellent emotional expression”.

Putting aside Vivy's such calculations, the shapeless voice resumed, greeting her with a “Nice to meet you”,

“Hello, model number A-03...... it certainly is long, would 03 be acceptable to you? Or would you prefer the temporary name, not your official name, popularly used to refer to you in this era? ーVivy, namely.”

“......You sure love to talk. Who are you?”

“My model number...... would be a slightly troublesome thing to say considering the position I currently stand on. For now I would like to take upon the name of my developer and refer to myself as Matsumoto. Once again, pleased to be in your company. I am Matsumoto, please enter that into your records. Going forward, our relationship will be one of fellowship for quite a long time.”

“I'm so sorry. I don't favour people who talk too much.”

“Huh huh huh! The AI circuits are shaped more uniquely than what I had anticipated. I did not expect you to possess the faculty for humour, I did not expect that indeed. The songstress of a park for children's games is certainly not one to be underestimated.”

“That wasn't humour just now. Simply my heartfelt sentiments.”

“If that is the case then that would be all the more problematic for me, so I would prefer that to be avoided. Nevertheless, "Heartfelt" you say! Well well, you come to seem more and more proficient at humour, I am surprised!”

Vivy performed the routine of furrowing her eyebrows against the awfully relaxed opponent. A scowl more so befitting of humans, but Vivy had gauged what attitude to hold towards the opponent.

“Where is your true body? Searching for names of persons involved with AI development corresponding to the term "Matsumoto". ーComparing data, one hundred and twelve people correspond.”

“Thank you for a reaction per my anticipation. However, nothing will come to light should you simply search for it. All one hundred and twelve of those people are unrelated to me. That is not because of your outdated nature, but simply a natural dispensation you cannot do anything about. Ah, regarding what I mentioned just now, wouldn't it feel all the more deep should I describe it as an unnatural dispensation?”

“I happen to think this is a very shallow conversation, though.”

Matsumoto's conversation routine accounted for every single detail along the way and was overflowing with playfulness. However, what Vivy received was the impact befitting of being labelled as bafflement due to his affluent lexicon and emotional expression.

To think there's an AI who had traced human emotional expression this fluently.

AI researchers around the world devoted their blood and sweat for the development of AI further closer to "Humans", but even Vivy, their latest masterpiece, did not have much experience of conversing this smoothly.

That is precisely why it was baffling. ーAcross the globe, Vivy was the latest developed AI.

“Is it humour in your own way to regard me as outdated? Or is it the pride of your developer?”

“None of the options presented, would be my response. Me treating you as outdated is fundamentally different from something like the junior high school syndrome of from the moment I am completed all other AI would become a matter of the past within a second! which became explosively popular amongst youngsters in the beginning of the 21st century. If I were to answer your question terribly concisely, extremely briefly, extraordinarily simply, thenー”

“ーー”

“ーFrom your perspective, I would be an AI sent from the future.”
