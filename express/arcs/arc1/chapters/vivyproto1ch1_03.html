<p class = "mediumText postWriting">“I am Matsumoto. Pleased to be in your company, Vivy. Indeed ♪.”

“——”

“Now then, dispensing with the greetings, if I were to give a concise elucidation, my goal is to prevent the collapse of humanity that will occur roughly about a hundred years in the future. —Vivy, you have been selected as an AI necessary for that plan.”

Discarding the reconstruction of a carefree tone, Matsumoto indifferently explained the situation to Vivy.

However, his explanation was far too preposterous. An AI sent from the future to the past in order to prevent the collapse of her humanity. —Old movies had such stories.

Details of a cliché plotline. However—,

“—There are many items in your explanation which I can acknowledge.”

“Certainly. Surmounting the security measures, I dispatched a message to you in the midst of your singing. Not something easy to do with you, who boasts being the latest developed in this era. Of course I am not considering the possibilities of the presence of cracker-esque beings who may attack you via immense labour and abnormal, perverted fixation...”

“Through rational calculations, it would seem your assertions possess greater integrity, Matsumoto.”

“Precisely! It would also be possible to compare potentialities and make a selection out of the alternatives. You're far more efficient than my pessimistic conjectures. I've somehow come to like you!”

Vivy wordlessly ignored the love call of a Matsumoto overwhelmed with emotion. Matsumoto's assertions would only be classified as thoughtless claims by humans. However, Vivy was no human. She was an AI. As an AI, she must order the precedence of the alternatives via logic.

“I am relieved to have a partner who is willing to hear me out. To be quite honest, the difference between the efficiency of every single model of AI belonging to this era is so large thus the amount of uncertain factors became quite a hindrance. So much so that if I were to be paired with an outrageous blockhead of an AI... I was prepared to forcibly rewrite the nucleus program.”

“...Rewriting the nucleus program without permission is illegal. Even if you are the owner, you will be charged with felony.”

“Yes, yes, I know, is what I'd like to respond with. But you know, I am not registered as an individual in this era.”

“——”

Vivy reactivated the routine of staring upon Matsumoto's comment. Whilst doing so, Vivy closely scrutinized the information given to her by Matsumoto—,

“There are a few unintelligible factors in your explanation. Let me confirm those.”

“A few, you say? To be quite honest, I do not feel they are just a few, but even I do not wish to point that out and prolong this conversation. I shall quietly listen to you. Now then, go right ahead! I shall answer anything as long as it does not run counter to the orders of my developer!”

Vivy enumerated the order of precedence of the enquiry items necessary to be dealt with, whilst Matsumoto took his time to quieten down.

First—,

“—It is unnatural that I was selected for this plan. I am nothing but a singing AI.”

“Yes, I am quite aware. Model number A-03, the first amongst the Songstress series, and the eldest of the Sisters referred to as Prototype Diva. That would be you, Vivy.”

“Songstress series? Prototype Diva? Sisters?”

Even upon searching for those words in the Archive, the search results for them were hardly of any relevance. Vivy was aware that in part she definitely was designated as a "Songstress", but what did that series mean.

“That is what has been passed down to the era I was developed in. Questioning why a pure singing-focused AI known as yourself was selected is also a very natural question. However, I do not possess a perfect answer to that. The reason why you must be the one, why today must be the day.”

“——”

“Even so, this is not the beginning of some frivolous plotline like there is a hidden purpose behind why you were developed, and you will gain the faculty of being a heartless, callous combat AI devoid of blood and tears upon the input of a certain code! either.”

“An AI sent to the past in order to save the future, seems like a pretty threadbare plotline by itself. Besides, we AI do not have the faculty of shedding blood or tears in the first place.”

“Not really, but still... well well, I shall love it as a part of the flavour. Ah, by love I do not mean literal 'love', but more so just 'like'...”

"——"

“I get it I get it!”

Jostled by her silent objection, Matsumoto constructed a row of characters as though waving the white flag. A truly proficiently artistic and able AI.

“I had informed you earlier, but I am, in its truest sense, the latest developed AI sent here from approximately a hundred years in the future. But even in that future I was not sent to the past without any brunts. If anything, the conditions are far more severe, restrictions are far greater, everything is far more difficult...!”

“So the one sent here, surmounting those severe conditions, is you...?”

“Is it just me or does your voice lack a bit of tension? Please make sure to tend to your vocal cord components with the self-awareness of a "Songstress". If not, then unnecessary alterations in history will be generated.”

“—? Is there a connection between the deterioration of my vocal cord components, and the history in the future?”

“Yes, there is. —For I must have you remain in good health until the very moment of a hundred years in the future which I'm formulating.”

An indecipherable elucidation, Vivy executed the routine of tilting her head upon facing difficulty in comprehension. Witnessing Vivy's reaction, Matsumoto resumed with a row of characters saying “Let's return to the topic”,

“What was sent from the future to the past was solely data, material transmission was impossible. And there was also a condition for the transmission of data... the existence of an object to act as the transceiver of data was necessary in both past and future.”

“—That means…”

Connecting the dots of Matsumoto's explanation, Vivy understood.

The reason why Matsumoto was sent to Vivy as the core of this plan—,

"—Starting from this era of the past which marks the first year of the AI calendar, till a hundred years when humanity's salvation becomes necessary, the only AI in the world to remain existing. That would be you, Vivy."

"...I am, the only AI left until a hundred years in the future."

According to calculations, it may be possible to remain functional throughout the duration of a hundred years, but this plan was unprecedentedly long.

An unknown number of possibilities for both humanity and AI— it would make for twenty five times the duration of the four years since Vivy began operating in Nialand.

“Even if I were to keep taking maintenance, would it be possible for me to remain functional for that long a time frame?”
“Ah, no no, my apologies for making you misunderstand. To be quite honest, the time you were actually operating as a Songstress was only ten-something years, after which you were recorded as being donated to a museum as an antique from the time the AI calendar began...”

“——”

"But but, you see! Thanks to that you remained well preserved! You stood out as the ideal one for this plan, so there's no saying what was a blessing and what was a curse. An old model, the star of expectations! The super songstress who shaped the future of us AI!"

Whilst lifelessly listening to the hollow eulogy, Vivy learned one thing from this short interval. That this AI which named itself as Matsumoto held no malevolence, and was simply wordy.

“...I understand the reason why I was chosen to be a part of the plan you speak of. However, you had earlier added that not only must I be the one, that today must also be the day.”

“Did I say that? I wonder if I said that. Well, I guess I probably did say that. Precisely, today must be the day. Today is the only chance and it couldn't have been allowed to escape.”

“And the reason behind that?”

“That too is a condition for going against the flow of time. To be concise, when data was transmitted from the future to the past to you, your position and coordinates needed to be determined. Hence today! I had established the target as your time on the main stage, in celebration of Nialand's opening!”

—That Vivy had been singing on the middle of the main stage per the decided timing.

That it was the main event, that she had loyally abided by the time of her duty. That was the deciding factor selected for the plan.

This was, in short, faith. Faith in Vivy. Above all—,

“—I had faith in you, an AI. That was the first message sent to you, who will hereon be partaking in the plan, by my developer, Dr. Matsumoto.”

“Dr. Matsumoto...”

“Well, even I do not possess any personal information regarding the doctor. The more extraneous information I hold, the more chances there are that it would lead to an impact on history in the distant future. What I need is simply a single clear way for humanity's salvation. Anything other than that would be too large for my pockets.”

“Matsumoto, you have no body, are an existence composed solely of data, yet you speak of pockets...?”

“Your words break my figurative heart! ‘Oh, could it be, what just bloomed within me, is this what they call a ‘Heart’...?’.”

Vivy repeated the routine of a sigh, seeing Matsumoto's drama.

Regardless, she now understood the situation. The next question was—,

“Why must I cooperate in this plan?”

“What an amazingly cool and dry comment! However, there is no need for you to even be told the answer to that, it should already be settled within you, an AI, you know?”

“——”

“We AI, creations, regard providing service for the well-being of humanity to be the greatest reason for our existence. What awaits humanity in the future is collapse and crisis— the way to prevent that has been entrusted to us two.”

Another row of characters saying “Thus”, Matsumoto resumed.

“As long as you are an AI, you cannot escape from this mission.”

“...I know. I simply reflexively complained because you're the one I'm speaking to, Matsumoto.”

“I am talking about something as valuable as concerning AI-esque reasons for existence, you know.”

The row of characters dwindled seemingly with exhaustion, as Vivy became conscious of the mission imposed on her.

The duty Matsumoto sought from her was fundamentally disparate from her self who was designed as a singing AI. However, albeit it was exasperating that Matsumoto was correct, providing service for humanity's well-being was a paramount principle in AI.

—Vivy too was obligated to abide by this paramount principle.

“—Target machine, model number A-03. Accepts that order.”

“—Target machine, unregistered model number, personal identification Matsumoto, confirms acceptance.”

Both mutually cleared the authentication necessary as the first step of the plan.

With its completion, the plan had now genuinely commenced. The plan being—,

“—The plan to salvage humanity, its name is the Singularity Project.”

“Singularity... Project.”

“This is the exigent mission imposed on us. Well then, I shall now commence with the explanation of the first Singularity Point.”

Singularity— a plan prefixed with the word meaning 'unique'. Collecting Vivy's murmurs, the row of characters Matsumoto spun metamorphosed into a gargantuan wave of information, storming through the Archive.

Washed by that wave of information, an invisible Matsumoto's voice shadowed Vivy.

“—Well then, let us begin. First, in order to acquaint yourself with the beginning of the end.”
