    <h2 class="brightText">Is It Worth Watching?</h2>
    <p class="mediumText" style="font-size:1.1em">
      To make a long story short, if you like The Promised Neverland (Season 1) then you'll like Shadow's House. It follows a similar style wherein Living
      Dolls are taken in by the Shadow family to be their servants and they immediately pile on the doubts. For those who haven't watched The Promised
      Neverland, Shadow's House is a rather slow burn at the moment without any action or anything, mostly just light drama and plenty of character
      development and worldbuilding. It flips, sometimes violently, back and forth between the horror and discomfort that's insinuated, and the lighthearted
      and happy nature of the main character. If you aren't committed to a well-thought out story that doesn't rush itself this isn't for you. If you're
      looking for a show that keeps you captivated and trying to guess where it takes you next, and don't mind the lack of action then I couldn't recommend
      this show more.
    </p>
    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:6%">A Second Side To Everything</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Shadow's House plays on duality incredibly heavily, and with its content and characters it works perfectly. The humans of Shadow House are shown to
        be 3 dimensional shadows in the cold open of silence and background music in the first episode. Immediately eyebrows are raised at everything: the
        fantastical industrial revolution-esque mansion, the sheer size of the house, all the tasks being done, and then the train emitting a deep black
        soot is shown as it makes its way up to the house. On this it carries one of our main characters, a Living Doll. There's more still but for now I'm
        skipping the rest of the plot to go right to the opening which makes more sense to be attached to this curiosity. The opening plays on every aspect
        of duality and curiosity that those first few moments raised and then some. The characters dance in pairs on a stage and are shown swapping with one
        another, each pair of dancers looking nearly identical (though one is a shadow and the other a Living Doll). The opening also plays with negative
        space in the shadows of a few characters to show places in the mansion. This entire take is covered in head to toe with story and information that
        will slowly make sense as we learn more about Shadow's House, but for now, on the visuals alone consider me hooked. The styling, the sense of
        curiosity, horror, and discomfort, the understanding of something evil. There's just so much going on to set the tone of the story, and each
        frame makes perfect use of it to provide an incredibly eerie and unique introduction entrenched with duality.

      <p>
        To pick up where left off in the story of Shadow's House, the train is shown alongside a few other scenes of Shadow House family members, and
        then it changes to a Shadow pouring out drinks into small shot glasses. Each of these glasses is given to what looks like a child as they drink it
        and then recite an incredibly eerie speech, "Let us ever remember. The Shadow's are an outstanding family of nobles. To serve them is the pride and
        joy of every living doll.". This alone should have everyone questioning the reality and existence of these "Living Dolls". Are they actual dolls and
        this is some sort of acclimation procedure? Are they human and being made into dolls? There are plenty of questions to be answered in just this
        scene. As a little interjection, during this speech scene there's a piece where the two Shadow family members administering the drinks turn to look
        at each other, taking up the majority of the screen. In this moment the only child/doll that remains visible is our main character. As the tone
        switches the "Dolls" are shown to be lying perfectly still on what definitely seem like coffins and some foreboding organ music swells, our main
        character front and center again. As a door beings to close, removing all light from the room, small little ghost-like shadows float into view atop
        each "Doll". Just as the door finally shuts the shadow of a girl seemingly sits up only to be masked by the blackness. After this moment our main
        character awakes in that same box they fell asleep on, the box being eerily similar to a coffin with an added grate to look out of.

      <h2 class = "brightText">A Character-Centric Story</h2>
      <p class = "mediumText">
        Shadow's House is quite the slow burn in terms of story and interest, opting to focus largely on its characters and moving them forward, allowing
        the plot to follow naturally. With the setting and understanding of the show this decision makes sense as the main character, a Living Doll, is shown
        to only interact directly with the Shadow family member she serves named Kate. This complete and total isolation and lack of understanding perfectly
        sets up exposition for the audience, as well as a great chance for our Living Doll to grow and learn. This episode occurs in 2 places, the room of
        the Living Doll, and the room of the Shadow family member Kate. The Living Doll is tasked with being a servant to Kate, cleaning up all of the
        soot that the Shadow family member produces. This first episode largely revolves around each getting used to the other, the Living Doll understanding
         who, and to a degree what, Kate is and Kate understanding the empty slate that is her Living Doll servant.

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Blink And You Might Miss It</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        There's no super fast paced action in this episode, no intense discoveries or anything of the sort. What there is, however, is plenty of small nods and
        pieces that explain the Shadows and their existence. While most of it is covered in dialogue the art and animation plays into it heavily as well. The most
        notable part is the use of side profiles with Kate. Because she's a Shadow you can't discern any detail from looking head on, but in the show they make
        use of side-profiles to show emotion and at some points turn her to face head on so you can't read her expression at all. An excellent way to show and
        hide emotion and information from the viewer. Another aspect is the detail in the uses of soot, which we're told is directly correlated to emotion somehow.
        When Kate wakes up she's covered in soot, when she places her hand on the wall in the morning it leaves behind the faint print of soot. When she gets
        anxious in the episode soot is shown to be emanating from her head. These details fade into the background very quickly but they're shown to be
        everywhere and they can add all sorts of information when taken in.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The motto of this show may as well be "Happiness with a side of horror" with how they go about it. The Living Doll is shown to be so happy and energetic
        that the show can't help but absorb her personality, but that doesn't mean that the horror is non-existent. In this first episode it's shown mostly in
        existential ways, such as the Living Doll questioning whether or not she'll be "thrown out" if she breaks while the screen pans to a broken doll in a bag.
        They continue to pose complex questions with the Doll asking why she was created to look like a human. Once Kate answers the question the Doll moves to
        the one everyone was waiting for, Is Kate Human? In a potentially unnoticed movement Kate turns her head so that none of the features of her face are
        visible when she responds. Immediately after this the show snaps back to happiness with the Living Doll enjoying a nice piece of bread. The playfulness
        between blurring the lines of Horror and Lightheartedness is excellently executed and leaves nothing to be desired, aside from more information of course.

      <p>
        Shadow's House feels incredibly close to the "whodunnit" murder mysteries of Live Action movies. There's so many questions, so many curiosities that are
        posed to the viewer within moments of watching. The show makes incredible use of it's "closed-mouth" approach to storytelling, giving the viewer tiny crumbs
        of information to piece together to create intricate theories, wild conspiracies and more. Each scene moves the story forward, even if you don't realise it,
        in such a well-thought out way you can't help but be impressed with the forethought. The mystery of the Shadow House, Living Dolls, and the relationship
        between Kate and her servant remain an important aspect that's to be explored via the duality of these characters.
