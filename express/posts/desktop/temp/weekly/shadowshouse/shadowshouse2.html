    <h2 class="brightText">A Well Worn Mask</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      Episode 2 starts off with a disconcerting monologue about the dirtiness caused by the soot that they produce, and as soon as her last words are
      spoken we're whisked away to Emilyko and her chipper nature. We follow Emilyko on her regular routine serving Kate alongside some cute dynamics
      like Emilyko sneaking into the room every so often to see if Kate's awake. Once she is and Emilyko begins to clean Kate makes a remark about Emilyko
      being summoned outside of Kate's room to clean, the idea exciting Emilyko. This whole introduction to the episode and subsequent content are largely
      very up beat and happy, but all of the interactions and content wear a mask hiding the true intent. Through the happy spoken words there exists a
      grim truth, a happy song hiding white lies, a fake smile. This episode is showing the viewers the kind of existence the dolls live, some sort of
      half-truth world where they believe they're living great and all is well and happy. Looking from the outside though it's easy to understand that
      somethings not right, but the attitude and disposition of Emilyko lulls you into a false sense of safety and brings you closer to something that
      can feel more Slice Of Life than what the series really is. The art style also really lends itself to this for the most part. While darkness
      definitely plays a role in the show, the brightness and cheerfulness carried throughout along with a sense of wonder at times integrates perfectly
      making it even more challenging to see through at times. Everything works together incredibly well to give hints as to everything going on whilst
      keeping the major revelations and concepts under wraps.
    </p>
    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:6%">Introduction To Our Supporting Cast</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        In the second episode we're also introduced to some of our supporting cast, mostly the living dolls that will surround Emilyko directly. The first
        one we meet is Mia, who comes to collect Emilyko to clean outside of Kate's room. Mia helpfully explains that she lives in the room above Emilyko's.
        Mia is clearly older as she's taller and more mature, which begs a few questions about the nature of the dolls and Shadows House. Regardless, Mia
        brings Emilyko and another girl that joined up with them named Lou through a series of secret passages to the great hall of the house. The scale
        of the hall is absolutely massive and the first few scenes play out like a Disney movie. Countless numbers of living dolls moving around in different
        groupings and attire cleaning all sorts of places, even the ceiling. There's so much wonder in this part that you forget the rest of what you've
        experienced. Once the trio is done taking in the scenery a fourth living doll approaches and introduces themselves as Rosemary, or Rose for short.
        Rose is the oldest of the group and as such is their leader, her personality making her come off as something akin to the mother of the three, Mia
        being the eldest and Emilyko and Lou seemingly the same age. Within the great hall we can also see quite a few of the other Living Dolls that were
        featured in the opening and ending. The characters are all very soft in terms of personality and mesh together very well, causing the great hall
        scene to be incredibly light hearted and happy despite some of the more grim dialogue that comes from Mia. Out of the entirety of the group Mia seems
        to be the most confident in nature, and as such happily drills into Emilyko her place in Shadows House and the fact that she exists to serve the
        Shadow Family, and that it's the greatest honour and such. It's straight up propaganda but Mia says it so smoothly and happily that the meaning
        behind it doesn't connect right away.

        <h2 class = "brightText">Literally Going Up In Smoke</h2>
        <p>
          Though our interactions with Kate are short in this episode it illuminates the power that they hold even more. In the first episode we're shown soot
          emanating from Kate's head a single column when she got anxious or nervous. In this episode however we get to see Kate properly upset when Emilyko gets
          one of her dolls wet. In this outburst Kate gets very frustrated and angry and several columns of soot billow out from her, and when she slams her hand
          on the table soot is splattered lightly on contact. The tension in the room is palpable despite not being able to see Kate's emotions which is impressive,
          once Kate finishes a harsh chastising of Emilyko she heads for the bath and we see the aftermath of the outburst. On the ceiling a massive amount of soot
          has collected in a form similar to that of Magnetic Ferrofluid when in the presence of a magnet (that black liquid that gets all spiky when near a magnet).
          Emilyko attempts to clean the soot off with no luck, no matter how hard she tries the stuff refuses to budge. The soot only removes itself after Kate
          returns from her bath and apologizes for her outburst, as soon as she finishes the soot releases and falls to the ground in a single pile, surprising
          both Kate and Emilyko. Immediately you understand the power of the Shadow family better. The soot is not simply a by-product of their existence, but
          a tool that is most likely cultivated in some degree. Soot that will stay put until it is released, emotions being the trigger. While not wildly useful
          it definitely has potential. The only question is if the form of the soot is controllable, if so it would be possible to create something akin to that
          soot bug that Kate squashed earlier.

      <p class = "mediumText">
        Episode two covers a lot on some of the more complex aspects of existence as a Living Doll. The first indication of this odd complexity is with Emilkyo
        and co. when Emilyko is handed her soot cleaning kit in the great hall. Emilyko's reaction, while incredibly cute and pure is at the same time at it's
        incredibly grim. Her whole existence in the Shadow House has been 2 rooms, one of which she wakes up in a box. This is her first time owning something,
        her first time being able to say that something is purely hers, and all it's just a cleaning kit that she needs to complete her duties. The immediate
        response to understanding this exchange is that individuality is crushed by the Shadow Family in their Living Dolls, which does make sense despite being
        unethical. This understanding furthers itself when we move forward in the episode to when Emilyko damages Kate's doll causing her outburst. In her rage
        against Emilyko's mistake she strikes the nail on the head. She berates Emilyko for not understanding the importance of possessions and how they should
        be treated, of course Emilyko would make that mistake because she's a Living Doll, she could never cherish something, right? It's a tough line to swallow,
        but as shown Emilyko is a quick learner so whilst she repairs Kate's doll while Kate's in the bath, she makes herself her own doll so that she can cherish
        it. And cherish it she does as she quickly takes a fall trying to catch her doll while cleaning the exterior of a window. Kate quickly comes to check on
        her and to get her back to the room as quick as possible but they're intercepted by a Mia and her Shadow. The scene becomes incredibly eerie when you
        realize that Mia is acting as the Shadow's face as she mocks Emilkyko and Kate. The movements are perfectly matched frame by frame as you'd expect, but
        the experience of it is incredibly eerie. The Shadow gives us some helpful information regarding the duo. Emilkyo is supposed to act as Kate's face, and
        it's a pretty large offense that two left their room before the "debut". Once the Shadow, who's name is Sarah, lets the two pass Kate commends Emilyko's
        fast development as they make their way back to the room.

      <p>
        While we continue to learn so much about Shadows House and everything it compasses, we still sympathise with Emilyko in our lack of understanding, and what
        exactly Shadows House is. The mystery uncovers more questions as you did deeper, it's like a Hydra in that sense. Find the answer to one question and two
        more take its place. Living Dolls are an incredible enigma in their existence, never telling you the answer to whether they're human or something else.
        What's the importance in floors in the Shadow House? Currently the best theory is that it's based on age or completing the debut. Who is the Lord
        Grandfather, how many inhabitants are there in the Shadow House, what is the objective of the Shadow Family, how do they make their money, how are
        dolls created, how is soot controlled and formed...
