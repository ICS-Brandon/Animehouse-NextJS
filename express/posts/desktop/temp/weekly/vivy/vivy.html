    <h2 class="brightText">Is It Worth Watching?</h2>
    <p class="mediumText" style="font-size:1.1em">
      Something to first understand is that Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song is a story penned by the same author as Re: Zero, Tappei Nagatsuki. While Re: Zero isn't universally
      popular, it is fairly well known. Re: Zero is a story revolving around a young boy with a power he has coined "Return By Death" which drives the story forward.
      Overall it is very much a shounen type show through and through. Vivy, on the other hand doesn't follow that strict typing. It's dark, inhumane and questions the
      very basics of existence and emotion. Can you enjoy it by watching an AI fight through the ages to ensure the survival of the human race against the ever-increasing
      intelligence and awareness that AI are developing? Absolutely, and you wouldn't really feel like it's missing much. But in looking at it in only the prototypical
      shounen lens of yesteryear you miss a large aspect of this show. There is detail in each scene, meaningful dialogue outside of its intense moments, and excellent
      characterization and animation of these androids. So, it's definitely a watch for anyone interested in the shounen genre, but for those that aren't interested in
      that sort of strict typing Vivy offers some deep drama, introspection and existentialism for those willing to be along for the ride.
    </p>
    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:6%">A Jarring Entry</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The first episode starts off with exercising the basic premise of the show in an interesting way: a battered woman with blue hair walks
        down a hallway prepping her voice to sing while her inner monologue states, "My mission is to make everyone happy by singing.". Just as she exits the hallway into a
        bright light, the screen glitches as the aspect ratio changes to narrow in and a faded overlay comes atop the scenery. In this view a woman with pink hair walks
        onto the large stage and starts singing whilst the view pans out and smoke and flames are shown rising from the area of the stage. This is where the show sets its tone.
        The AI's of a theme park called NiaLand are shown to be brutally murdering any and all customers. It's not just implied, but shown in some brutal scenes of
        small spherical drones crashing into people's heads to kill them, skulls being crushed, and people being ran over by vehicles. The only indication of hostility
        outside of their actions is the AIs glowing red marker on their necks. Each and every humanoid android has this marker and it is shown to be glowing red to
        associate it with violence. Since their true emotions/actions aren't being shown the episode decides to crank the level of disturbance to near its max as the
        pink-haired woman continues her high-energy, happy song as a massacre ensues. The mix of positive imagery with negative actions does wonders to set up the show and
        our understanding of artificial intelligence.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        After this brtual scene is fully played out and the groundwork is laid for the story we are introduced to how AI came to be in this world. In a logical turn of events
        the developers had initially tried to create AI with the objective of being an All In One unit, which was shown to be a near immediate failure. With this in
        mind they created the first Single Objective Artificial Intelligence, Diva, an android with the sole objective of making people happy through song. With this
        they establish an important aspect of the story that is touched upon frequently. The advent of singular objective AI's causes the world begins a dangerous path
        that leads to the war AI's enact against humanity. The usage of this single objective is very interesting and unique in that the AI allows the objective to
        be manipulated to justify actions. While someone's objective may be to sing really well, if it can be rationed that something will make them sing better they
        will undertake the task. This definition and usage allows for very nuanced understanding and questioning for each AI.

      <h2 class = "brightText">Animation And Androids</h2>
      <p class = "mediumText">
        Animation is something that's always fluid and full of life and character, whereas androids can be stiff and calculated, not making any unnecessary movements
        or gestures. Vivy manages to capture this duality perfectly. With the main character Diva in episode one they show her smiling and happy on stage in one moment
        and then in the next as she recedes into the shadows the smile immediately fades. Within the same piece she is shown striking a pose that she thought may be
        useful since she had seen an idol do it before. The movements for the pose are very graceful and soft without sudden movement. Within the first moments of
        being shown Diva it's very much established what level of AI she is. There is no sense of self, no understanding of existence and no interest in the
        technically unnecessary. They continue to highlight this rift with a young girl Momoka who has befriended Diva. The girl
        clearly shares a bond with Diva and cares for her while Diva does not quite understand and is unable to properly reciprocate. The art keeps focus on
        this by showing Momoka next to Diva, as Momoka's skin tone is far more natural and lifelike where Diva's is whiter and pale. The rift between humanity and
        android is illustrated to be massive at the start of this episode and briefly shows the massive mountain that Diva must climb. Within this episode they also
        like to zoom in on Diva's eyes, showing the detail of them and the effective emotional deadness. They don't make these comparisons explicit but when you
        pay attention there are countless pieces of animation and art that show who and what Diva is.
      </p>
      </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">The Struggle For Existence</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The majority of the first episode revolves around Diva's life as a stage performer, and her objective to make it to the "main stage", the largest stage at
        NiaLand. Within these first few moments It's clearly shown that it's purely her objective to reach the stage, there's no desire or interest in what is done.
        It's only once the plot is introduced to the viewer that a change begins to stir. When preparing to start her next performance after her talk with Momoka,
        Diva is suddenly rendered "unconscious"  and awakes in a digital place named "The Archive", a database for all the AIs in use. In this scene the colors and art change drastically as they
        become more bright and vibrant, and almost washed out by the bright lights coming from the windows in this digital room Diva is in. Upon closer inspection
        the room mimics that of a high school music classroom with music stands set up, and a grand piano at the back where Diva stands. Diva herself has changed
        as well, in this imagery she wears a schoolgirl uniform and her skin tone looks more natural. While asking the Archive what happened she walks over to the
        window and grazes the keys of the piano with her hand as she passes. Once she makes it to the window we're shown her face in a reflection. The most notable
        difference being that her eyes are like a person's, not the hardware that you see in the first closeup shot of her face. This scene begs many questions. Is
        this how Diva sees herself? Is this how she wants to be seen? Or is this the default protocol of an AI to better fulfill the lifestyle and existence of
        someone who's objective is purely to sing?

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        While in this dream-like state a robot comes crashing through the window to talk about Diva and set up the plot for the show. The AI that introduces itself,
        and does so very cheerily, is an artificial intelligence sent from 100 years in the future to help Diva save humanity from eradication by AI. Of course the
        thought process is absurd to even AI so to convince Diva, the self-named Matsumoto shows her the visions of the future we were treated to at the start
        and exposes information about a targeted attack on an official that will occur within the park. In a split second of calculation Diva does what any AI
        would do, and makes a break for the scene. She makes it to the official just in time to save him as the explosion targeted as a warning to him goes off.
        The movements as Diva runs through the streets are awkwardly stiff and fit perfectly into an uncanny valley. However, in saving the official and avoiding
        his bodyguards her movements suddenly become very fluid and lifelike. These two scenes highlight the effectiveness and styling of artificial intelligence.
        In running there is most definitely inefficiencies in the movement of a person, but in the make or break moments like saving someone calculations aren't
        purely all that matters. With the savoir of this official Diva essentially signs on to save humanity with the help of Matsumoto, despite that fact that
        he is endlessly annoying to Diva (mostly due in part to his more human speech patterns).
      </p>

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">A Robot On The Path To Humanity, Almost</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The episode leaves us at the end with Diva disguised carrying Matsumoto in the form of a teddy bear attempting to protect the official from being murdered
        so that they can stop a dangerous AI related law from being passed in his name. This episode end raises many questions and possible contradictions,
        such as: Why is she trying to save someone if her objective is to make people happy by singing? My answer to that is this, the official makes a
        comment about wanting to hear Diva sing at some point so with that explicit remark Diva is in a way required, or for better wording allowed, to save
        the official's life. Even still, with the given ambiguity of these objectives in the first episode she would be allowed to save anyone as they have
        the potential to become happy due to her singing. The story itself perfectly understands its own rules and outlines which allows for a very tight plot
        that explores the intertwined fates of Humanity, Artificial Intelligence, and the robot tasked with saving the world. And there's time travel from the
        future. Very cool.
