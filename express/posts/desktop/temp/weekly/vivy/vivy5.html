    <h2 class="brightText">An Ever-Changing Opening</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song revolves around an AI whose mission is to make people happy with her singing, so of course we'll have some great music, what was unexpected however was
      the level of integration of the music into the show. So far all of the openings have been unique in some way and this one cranks it up a notch. It starts with Diva on an indoor
      stage saying she'll finish with one of her hits from ages ago, which turns out to be the opening song for the show. The venue comes to life with all sorts of digital scenery as
      she begins her song and the opening credits roll. The dedication and time required to make a unique opening for each episode is impressive and shows how much the studio cares about
      the show as a whole. While it may not be the case, a thought that I've had while watching the various openings is that they develop and evolve as the story goes on in the same way
      that Diva/Vivy continues to improve as she toils away at her mission.

          After the opening Diva makes her way back to her room, which we find to have been drastically improved. She has a much more modern living space that is far larger than her
          previous, and it even has quite the view as it looks out at the Arayashiki. The interesting dilemma here from my perspective is that as Diva's improved she's been given a
          better living space. That sort of thing isn't an incentive for AI yet it's still given to her. Does she appreciate her new accommodations? Are they required by new laws
          regarding AI? It raises quite a few questions since it essentially proves all AI are not treated equally and resemble something closer to partial human rights, they get nicer
          living areas and the like but do they get any pay? Are they allowed personal belongings? Do they have "free" time? There's many questions that are left unanswered from seeing
          this new room alone. They most likely won't be answered but that's probably a good thing as we'd have to dive very deep into society, laws, and norms to uncover proper answers.
          Regardless, with Diva comfortable in her new room she asks her partner if there's been anything odd happening. They respond confidently that nothing of the sort could- with
          the impeccable timing Matsumoto has finishing off the sentence in place of Diva's partner you already know he was waiting for his chance to butt in. Rolling into the room in
          the shape of a cube Matsumoto introduces himself in his new form. Diva, unsurprisingly, isn't happy with Matsumoto as she proclaims its been 5 years since the Sunrise Incident
          and that the development of AI has been incredibly quick. In their conversation Matsumoto explains the difficulties they face as they're now on an explicitly divergent path than
          the future he came from, and that they played a role in the ever increasing pace of development in AI. Diva ends up being surprisingly agreeable and more calm in facing Matsumoto
          this time as she asks what her mission is while preparing.

        After Diva and Matsumoto's conversation ends we're brought into the middle of a high-speed car chase, which Vivy and Matsumoto politely interrupt by landing on the car being chased.
        Vivy disguises herself with a pair of sunglasses and a jacket, and upon seeing it the only thing I could think of was The Terminator. It's definitely not what they're aiming for, but when
        you put an AI robot in sunglasses and a jacket and make them act all cool you're gonna end up with Terminator. Regardless, War Machine Diva leaps into action and dispatches of the two cars
        giving chase with relative ease and have a little chat with the person being pursued. After getting the man to trust the pair he takes them to the coast where we see something that shouldn't
        be there. A massive, metallic, technological wonder; The Metal Float. The Metal Float is a facility run solely by AIs that produce all sorts of pieces for AI to keep them "alive" for as long
        as possible. After Vivy's done taking The Metal Float in, the man speaks to her, immediately realizing that she's Diva of NiaLand. Instead of trying to bluff that she wasn't Diva, Vivy comes
        clean about who she is and finds out that the professor found out about her accomplishments from the group that was pursuing him, Toak. Realizing who it was the professor invites the pair to
        his house, where we find a familiar face from the start of the episode, a female AI named Grace. The three of them sit down to discuss the Metal Float as the professor produces an item in the
        shape of a bacteriophage. He proclaims that the device will shut down the Metal Float and asks for Vivy and Matsumoto to accompany him to the island. When asking for his motivation it's found
        out that the professor had actually previously been a part of Toak but parted ways due to their extreme nature, citing that while he agrees with them partly they don't take a viable approach
        to matters. In the end of the conversation professor Saeki asks some harsh questions that many may have forgotten about. While we might not had realized it, Elizabeth and Estella were her
        sisters, and she had to destroy and stop them. Many, if not all, humans would have a terribly hard time doing something similar. The majority of viewers most likely didn't view the situation
        like that until Saeki prompts us with the question. Once he understands Vivy's resolve he sends them on their way to the Metal Float and they depart from his home. It's only upon leaving that
        Matsumoto tells us that Saeki and Grace are the first Human-AI marriage in history.

        Vivy and Matsumoto make their way onto the Metal Float with ease as they forge fake identities and an invitation to view the island. They're welcomed by a primitive looking AI that takes them
        on a tour of the island. Once they finish their greeting they make their way to an elevator and find themselves rather high up on the Metal Float, able to view the majority of it with ease.
        What they see is awe-inspiring and jaw dropping. A massive sprawling city of factories and buildings expands before them, multiple types of AIs moving about doing all sorts of work. The scale,
        organization, and synchronization of the city is wildly incredible and anybody looking at it would have trouble fulfilling the mission Vivy has undertaken. Matsumoto and Vivy verbalize the internal
        thoughts of the viewers stating it would be impossible for an AI to feel nothing when looking on at the wonder that is the Metal Float. Our next view of the Metal Float is from what seems to be
        either an art exhibit or waiting room. Clarification comes from our friendly tour robot M saying that it's a resting spot for future human guests. He explains that the resting area was built to aid
        the mission of the float, "To Ensure The Metal Float's Survival For Humankind's Sake". While Diva's stuck in thought over the comment M's made, the tour guide begins to move to the next room, in which
        we find a series of similar styled robots that were waiting to give a surprise welcome to their first guests. Before Diva can make a comment on the welcome the AIs begin to sing, they begin to sing one
        of Diva's songs specifically. As many would in Vivy's shoes she stormed out of the room, with M in tail. Here she apologizes for storming out of the room and asks M, "What does it mean to you to put your
        heart into something?". Initially he says he can't answer the question, but as Vivy begins to walk back to the room he starts to speak some more. Before she could finish her conversation with M they're
        interrupted by Toak attacking the Metal Float, forcing Vivy to inject the virus into M. Though the virus was successfully injected the Metal Float doesn't stop as its various robots work together to
        stop Toak from doing any damage.

      <p>
        In the moments where Vivy injects the virus into M we get to see his archive for a brief moment. In the archive we find the resting room Vivy was brought to full of laughter and young children playing.
        M is supervising the children as one approaches him to show them a drawing they made of  M holding hands with a girl. Though he's but a primitive AI, M displayed warmth and affection for the girl explaining
        that she can call him M, as it was a name given to him by people who were good to him. Before he can finish speaking the archive shuts down. These moments are very heavy as it shows the last moments of our
        AI friend named M, who only dreamt of being of help to humanity and making them happy. It makes the decision to shut down the Metal Float even more impossible to undertake after seeing how it operates. The
        ethics of striving to secure the existence of humanity is nearly non-existent at this point. So many AIs have shown happiness, desires, and hopes along the way that have had to be crushed for the sake of the
        human race that it makes you doubt it we're even all that worth it in the end. The treatment of so many existences that can dream, that can want, makes it so hard to justify what Vivy must do. And Vivy
        understands that in the end, she has to see and do so much to fulfill a mission that isn't even truly hers, but does it anyways. She's forced to be the monster and to see all the wishes and lives of those
        she thwarts become ash. Even though M is far more primitive and simpler than Vivy, he was more human than Vivy in his last moments, because if Vivy held onto even the slightest bit of humanity in those moments
        she would be unable to do what she has to.
