      Vivy: Fluorite Eye's song leaves us in an interesting space to continue with, where Diva is tasked by Matsumoto to save the Assemblyman Aikawa from Toak, which he
      defines as an anti-AI terrorist group trying to kill him and blow up the building. Diva's "objective" is to get Aikawa out alive, but the episode plays heavily on
      what an objective is, how it is defined, and how it should be treated. Overall, this  episode plays heavily on themes discussed in the previous as well as using
      plenty of symbolism and visuals to better relate to the story and it's cast. Episode 2 also offers far more action and information than episode one, so if you
      were on the fence after the first one watching this episode will definitely help you understand the pacing of the series and how it goes about telling its story.
      For future reference, it seems as though the show tells its stories in twos. Each pair of episodes telling an open and shut sub-arc of the overall plot of the
      series, which works really well. Just know that you should plan to end on an even episode if you aren't watching it live, otherwise you'll either get left hanging
      on the story or you'll end up watching more than you bargained for.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        When watching the episode I couldn't help but think the author took inspiration from Die Hard in its plot. I mean, it's a single robot trying to make an escape
        against an evil organization. This thought may just speak to the ever-present nature of Die Hard, but it was one of my initial thoughts upon watching. However,
        the similarities end pretty quickly. Most importantly Diva refuses to kill any of the members of the terrorist group Toak. During the episode Matsumoto comments
        on this saying that it's statistically impossible that any of the Toak members would come to see her sing, so attempting to preserve their life is pointless.
        Regardless, Diva uses the logic of her directive to justify her actions. She does it once again when Matsumoto attempts to improve her combat capabilities
        which she promptly stops. She cites her objective as reason, but my first thought is something more. In the same way that people can wonder about losing
        themselves perhaps Diva is worried about losing sight of her objective to make people happy by singing. In the end Matsumoto has to save the day again as
        Diva hesitates and freezes up, causing their plan to take some unexpected turns.

        While taking one of their accidental detours in the plan to get Aikawa to safety they end up essentially cornered as a Toak member blows up one of the barriers
        Matsumoto used to block them off. Because of his arrival, which is shortly followed by the leader of Toak making it through, Matsumoto detonates a bomb above
        them to block off the intruding members of Toak, bar the lone one that broke through earlier. After the explosives blew up a large piece of rubble falls from
        the ceiling where the lone member was. In a slightly surprising turn of events Diva rushes to stop the slate of concrete from crushing him. This scene became
        particularly interesting for several reasons, mostly the fact that an AI saved the AI-hating terrorist. The look of hatred and fear is shown excellently well
        on the young man's face as we're shown Diva who's in rough shape. The design done on her is excellent, they showed perfectly that despite all exterior looks
        Diva is still an AI. The blue fluid substituting blood, fake muscles, skin, and bone, and those Fluorite Eyes they love to show us. During this scene Matsumoto
        reveals why Diva was chosen. She was the only AI left untouched through the 100 years of existence, due to being closeted away as a relic. As Matsumoto essentially
        berates her we're shown some of that blue fluid splatting on the floor, but can't see Diva's face a pretty obvious nod to being symbolic of her crying. In a
        fairly shocking twist Diva almost shows hints of anger as she quips back at Matsumoto about herself, "For us AIs, it is not a matter of how long we operate.
        It is how we continue to operate, is it not?". After finishing the speech she find the "strength" to lift the concrete off herself and begins to calculate their escape.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The entire episode is quite beautiful throughout it in its entirety. The animation and visuals are incredible and the story perfectly thought out and well executed.
        The episode attempts to place emotions into something that should have none, which we all understand and wouldn't have been a question in the first episode. In
        this one though, that doubt is raised consistently through Diva, and Matsumoto's, choices and actions. Diva has second thoughts and questions certain aspects
        throughout these 20 minutes, something she would not have done previously. She acts on what can seem like impulse. She seems like she's getting angry. Everything
        is very subliminal but it would be stupid to say that it's not there. The impossibility is knowing if it's genuine or not, which is what the visuals aim to make a
        challenge. If Diva was only ever shown as Human Looking then you might not doubt it as much and think she's "changing" or "evolving", but every so often we're
        shown the inhuman side to Diva through visuals of her tattered body, her expressionless and pale facade, her Fluorite Eyes. Diva is objectively a beautiful android,
        there's no question about it. The subjective aspect is routinely shown in this beauty though, and goes both ways in the episode. The most notable and closest
        reference of this duality is in their daring escape of the building by jumping ship to another building after the explosives detonate. To reach the other building
        they have to make a run on what seems to be a landing pad, where the show tries very hard to make Vivy's movements rather inhuman. While they may not be human,
        the way Diva runs in the scene is beautiful in it's accuracy and efficiency. The movements are so calculated and prepared that it's impressive. However, when she
        makes her jump through the air to the next building is where the true beauty is. A single look at the image and you will be captivated. The positioning seems
        natural and there's just something inexplicable to it that hands it its beauty. The inability to put your finger on why it's so captivating is part of the reason
        that it is, it's not something that feels like it could be easily recreated, but something that happened in the moment and can't be replicated. And that's
        where Diva's charm and dilemma lies, her execution of existence isn't easily defined despite the fact that everyone knows her to be a "simple" AI compared to Matsumoto.

      <p class = "mediumText">
        The episode closes with Matsumoto disclosing all information about the future to his now official partner, Diva. While they shake hands a plane is heard flying above,
        and we are taken to the scenes of Matsumoto inhabiting some construction equipment while fighting Diva. Once she's knocked to the outside of the building we're shown
        it to be an airport with a plane taking off above. Zooming in on the plan we see Momoka briefly before it explodes into a massive fiery ball in the sky. In the silence
        of the rain we zoom in on Diva's Fluorite Eyes as rain accumulates around them as if tears were forming. This ending really drives home what Matsumoto is, an AI.
        Despite his quippy nature and more nuanced approach to existence he has his objective as well, which he talks about. The ending serves to show the ambiguity of the
        two and differences in existence. It also shows the grim path that the duo must take, unnecessary lives are unnecessary despite being valued. In their quest for the
        survival of humanity there isn't a clear cut right or wrong to their actions, only what is accepted as a possible solution. Here Diva begins to deviate from Matsumoto
        as her understanding of her objective shapes her views of right and wrong, but at the same time so does her shared mission with Matsumoto. Which objective will prevail,
        if any? Will Diva evolve and change as her interaction within her objectives change? Will she save the world, find and understand herself, both, or neither?
