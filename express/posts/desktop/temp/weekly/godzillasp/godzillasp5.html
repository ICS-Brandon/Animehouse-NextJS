    <h2 class="brightText">Dante's Inferno</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      After some quick introductions and Mei's meeting with Professor Li to prove Mei's understanding of archetype is valid we move to another important character. It's with him
      that we begin a long descent alongside some other men carrying weapons and our friend talks, reciting pieces of the famous poem Inferno, by Dante. Even though the man's a
      scientist he has a heavy focus on fairy tails, even telling the men walking with him not to take them lightly. While they make their casual descent, countless red particles
      float through the air like a pollen around them. The deeper they get the more that appear around them. When they finally reach the bottom they find their river of hell, a sea
      of the red pollen-like pieces that we find out are a different phase of archetype. The scientist grabs one of the pieces in his hand and it begins to glow, getting brighter
      as he puts more pressure on it until it breaks. After taking in the scenery for a moment the sea of Archetype erupts in front of them. On their way back up to safety the group
      spots a new kaiju among the explosion of red. It's not the kaiju they have to worry about though, as they have to reach the top of this bottomless pit before the massive opening
      closes on them. They manage to just barely outpace both the kaiju and the door as they make it above just in time, though while catching the breath the kaiju begins banging on
      the door signalling that it won't be kept in there forever. There's a lot to think about in these few brief minutes, the biggest thing being the kaiju. It seemed far more developed
      and capable than the Radon that were previously seen, and also far stronger and threatening. Perhaps the different phase of archetype could produce a more powerful kaiju. The next
      would be the intertwining of philosophy and religion with science, thanks to the comments on topics such as Dante's Inferno. There's not really any way that the supernatural has
      anything to do with the natural considering how much they've played archetype up but considering all the events it certainly seems important in the form of a prophecy or warning
      to the future. There's a lot of hypotheticals that arise from this scene but it's hard to know what's going to result in any new findings or information.

        <p>
          Once more we meet up with Yun and Haberu, the journalist still tagging along with them as they search for the monster. While talking to a pair of hunters they manage to catch a glimpse
          of it out of the corner of their eyes and give chase. After losing it for a moment they find some tracks, and blood from the monster. They quickly realize that the kaiju has been shot
          and injured, making it even more dangerous than before. Yun's not one to calculate danger when curiosity's on the line though and climbs a hill to find that the creature was right on
          the other side in a small pond drinking some water. Haberu and the journalist Takehiro follow behind after a while as Yun stares down the beast. While Yun is frozen in place the pair
          of hunters they had talked to earlier shows up and takes aim at the kaiju. As soon as the gun was raised the back of the monster turned an iridescent sort of color and its spikes began
          to shake back and forth, almost like an intimidation mechanism. That's not right though, as the one hunter takes a shot the spike reflects the bullet to just past the head of Yun,
          instilling him with even more fear than he had previously felt. Looking away for a brief moment Yun returns his gaze to the beast to find that it's disappeared. After this incident we
          meet once more with Yun and Mei as they go back and forth on how archetype operates, agreeing that it can go to the past but questioning how it makes it to the future. Yun then poses
          the question to Mei of "What does the future look like?" leaving both herself and all viewers stumped. The future isn't something that exists in a 3 dimensional space until the present,
          so being able to define the future in terms of our reality makes it nearly impossible, but not entirely.

          The next few minutes of the episode have us visiting all sorts of people to get up to speed on the pace of the world. We're first met with Sato discussing an image of Ashihara over the
          phone with a woman. In their conversation we get to hear that Misakioku was doing research on their skeleton in the closet and that the image in question is of Ashihara standing in front
          of the massive skeleton. After their call we follow alongside the same woman as she talks to a business man about archetype. Here we find out that archetype is a naturally occurring
          (to some degree) resource on Earth that can be mined and used, but that the Radon still prove to be of great interest thanks to the red dust they contain. The man says that the red dust
          is something similar to archetype and that they'd like to look into it some more. Moving further forward once more we find a series of responses from people in a small village while we
          watch images of the damage scroll across our screens. It's only when we see the large footprints in a field that we realize we're dealing with another kaiju. Towards the end of this part
          we find out that it's Takehiro inquiring with the locals about what's been going on, to find out that the government is hunting down the beast somewhere in the mountains. Next we catch
          up with media as they talk about the appearance of the sea serpent from the start of the episode, which they aptly name Manda. We also find out that the Radon have been spreading to other
          countries, in a rough circle with its origin at Japan. At the moment they say there's 6 countries that have confirmed sightings of Radon only for that information to be revoked as they
          cover the rapid spread of Radon across Asia making it all the way to areas such as Singapore. The news cycle abruptly ends as we fast forward to the small valley that the hunt for the
          'Anguirus' will begin in.

      <p>
        At what seems more like a hunter convention than an actual hunt we find droves of people dressed in reflective gear and no shortage of bureaucrats mingling amongst them. The preparation is
        fairly low effort but high enthusiasm as each aims for their chance at glory, the popularity to be gained from this moment even draws in an old friend of Goro's who brings in a pickup truck
        with a massive harpoon cannon in the back. In these moments before the hunt begins we also overhear some information about Ashihara looking into a specific type of Jellyfish  alongside some
        interesting companies that Sato hears about from the man in the conversation earlier. It's here we're introduced to a spider web of relations between companies being bought and sold and under
         new management, all of the threads pointing to Ashihara himself. After the expose from the friend of Sato we come back to the large open valley that begins to fill with danger. A gunshot is
          heard in the distance followed by radio chatter of Anguirus deflecting the bullets. From the edge of the valley we see the pickup truck that was carrying the men out to the hunting grounds
          barreling back towards Yun and the crew. From behind the truck the forest they emerged from begins to erupt as Anguirus comes forth, this time several times larger than previously. The
          truck carrying the harpoon cannon attempts to make a dent in Anguirus but with no luck, overturning their truck in the process forcing Jet Jaguar to once again square up against a Kaiju.
