    <h2 class="brightText">An <i>Interesting</i> Continuation</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      The second episodes continues almost directly from where episode one left us, the pterodactyl-like monster rudely interrupting the small festival
      that was going on. In only what can be described as bewildering the old man of Osaki Factory hops in the robot they were displaying at the festival
      to fight the beast. The entire fight some sort of odd music plays that only makes the fight more lighthearted and comical than anything else. Add
      to it the way the old man trash talks the beast (think Shakespeare with a southern twang) and you have an event that just doesn't line up with
      what's happening. The flying monster is something that's never been seen before but people are sitting there... watching an old man in a robot
      trash talk like Shakespeare while fighting it. It just doesn't sound like it makes sense does it? The weirdest part though is that it kind of
      does, and it works pretty well. They don't try to animate it like some high-stakes battle between the two but rather go the route that everyone
      else is thinking, a deranged old man wanted to fight the damn bird so god damnit is he going to do it. The fight continues to rage on even when
      the old man falls out of the aptly named 'Jet Jaguar' and a series of events that can only be defined as scientifically impossible to be
      successful but the only possible way of winning unfold to ensure that no one gets harmed in the brawl. There's not a single moment where the
      gravity of the situation shows up, but the show does such a great job as framing it as something so harmless it doesn't seem out of place
      whatsoever which makes it surprisingly enjoyable to watch. It's such a bizarre few minutes that you doubt that you're actually watching a
      show about Godzilla and friends, but let me assure you that you are. I think.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        As wildly weird and uppity as the opening scenes are the tone rapidly shifts as the Pterodactyl looking monster takes to the sky and some ominous music
        plays. What you would expect from this is for the beast to make a fatal attack on one of the characters or for more to show up but nothing of the sort
        happens. Instead the bird struggles in the air for a moment before plummeting to the ground, having died while mid-flight. Once the dust clears from
        the impact a crowd gathers around with a man touching the bird-looking creature and exclaiming that it's body is hot. Isn't that counterintuitive though?
        With no life a creature cannot produce heat so why would it be so hot? And why did it die while midflight? Immediately once again the feel of the episode
        pivots towards the curiosity that just ensued, showing us a slew of media regarding the existence and queries regarding the existence of the beast. These
        scenes are probably the most realistic rendering of modern media to ever grace a screen. The sheer ignorance and pompous attitudes, the popularized
        theories being spewed, the not-so-ethical debates. All of it is so on the nose as a critic for "mainstream" media that it's impressive it got the greenlight.
         The news anchors and hosts talk about how the animal died mid-flight, eventually pushing the blame to Outaki Factory and their robot. They theorize
         that it might be an extinct dinosaur, that there may be more, or that it's someone's lost pet even. The voices of the media even ask if what Outaki
         Factory did was ethical and if a civilian should be able to own a robot, which they called a weapon (despite it being no more lethal than a truck or
         something of similar size).  It's just such an apt and perfect response to the crisis that occurred that I couldn't help but be impressed with the
         awareness and understanding the writers wielded for this piece.

        <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:14%">Our First Encounter</h2>
        <p class = "gridPara mediumText">
          Upon our return to the factory Yun and Aberu are greeted by the third employee of Goro, Satomi. Satomi brings with her some food and a painting accompanied
          by some words from Goro, who's currently hospital bound. The painting depicts a massive beast of the ocean surrounded by similar looking pterodactyl-like beasts
          who appear to be servants to the massive monster. Goro gives warning to them by referencing the painting and saying there's more than one, and that next time it'll
          be a whole swarm of them. Haberu makes the comparison to the mural at the train station that we saw Mei take a picture of in the first episode while Yun misreads
          the title as "Koshira". Satomi corrects this to "Gojira" and immediately you can see the thread that the plot is pulling on come into view. The entire scene is
          steeped in foreshadowing alongside a little tidbit of interesting Japanese reference. The reference in name is that Yun says the monster in the painting looks like
          a whale. While not obvious unless you're a Godzilla buff, like pointless facts, or speak and/or are Japanese this comment is a reference to the aptly named Godzilla,
          or ゴジラ in Japanese. Godzilla got this name from having an appearance similar to that of a whale, クジラ (Kujira), and Gorilla, ゴリラ (Gorira). Mix  the two together
          and you get ゴジラ, or "Gojira". While not entirely useful or important it's a really interesting fact to know and a unique way of paying homage to the origins of
          the legendary Kaiju.

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Denpa Kaiju Radon</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        During a scene with our pair of supporting characters from Episode 1 Shunya and Tsunetomo we dive deeper into a world of mystery. Before Shunya can look further into
        the history of the company though we're interrupted by a TV broadcast, showing that more and more of the flying creatures have appeared dead. With more bodies to study
        the science behind their existence creeps into view. Apparently the beasts do not contain the homeobox gene, an essential building block in mutli-cellular organisms
        (mostly every living organism contains them in some capacity). Further more the monster uses similar structure to that of an electric eel, and doesn't have any digestive
        organs. The most peculiar piece of information is that the Kaiju possess high levels of Radon gas, which is where the monster gains its name. Radio Wave Kaiju Radon.
        Social media, of course, named the beast Radio Wave Kaiju Radon and a, in my opinion, mildly disturbing scene begins its course. Social media scrolls past while people
        sing a jingle about the monster and all sorts of merchandise flash up on the screen briefly. The background music helps to increase the air of discomfort alongside the
        repetition of some simple lyrics that end as abruptly as they started. The reaction of society towards its discovery and the incidents surrounding it are very accurate
        and that's what makes it uncomfortable. The accurate depiction of the ignorance and how media sensationalizes it all to grab more attention, and does so in the worst
        possible manner.

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">A Large Information Dump</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        This episode dumps a whole lot of information on the viewer compared to the last which may be a turn off for those looking for a Godzilla fight as soon as possible.
        For those that stuck around for the science, theory, and mystery this episode is a treat. Things like the homeobox gene aren't just some made up term, these are actual pieces
        of information from reality. Their ability to stich fantasy with reality is so wildly impressive I could watch a show purely based on the science that they're using. The
        attention to detail and acknowledgment of it all is just so incredible, the show has very clearly been planned down to the most minute detail and it's paying off massively.
        Godzilla SP has also heavily invested in telling multiple stories that weave back and forth with one another and personally I think it's paying off so far. It allows us
        more access to different information and perspectives and doesn't pin down a main character per se, so it's hard to discern who's overly important and who isn't. The
        storytelling and writing apparent in the series so far is just wonderful and makes me excited for what we'll learn and uncover in each episode.
