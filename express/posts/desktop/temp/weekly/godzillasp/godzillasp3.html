    <h2 class="brightText">The Voices Of Time Appear Again</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      The children that had spoke at the beginning of episode 1 appear once again alongside the opening act of the episode which shows us a massive flock of Rodan
      that look different from the ones in the previous episode. Even if you think you know who or what these children that are speaking are, odds are you're wrong.
       You might think they're Rodan, or some interdimensional being but neither fits the bill. The way they talk is childish but at the same time something wildly
       incomprehensible, almost like we're missing a massive piece of information. They talk as if they were a part of the world/reality that the show takes place
       in but you get the feeling that they don't really exist in the same way. They talk themselves in circles, contradicting one another as they ramble onwards in
       their conversation. They talk of all sorts of habits of the living: working, being born, playing, going to school, dying, and smiled. They all smiled, and
       flowed through time. Going back to watch this introduction a second time something about it is just oddly beautiful. It might be the narration of the group of
       whatever these beings may be, it might be the music full of concern and peril in the background. It might be the descriptions of time travel that these children-
       like creatures give. It might even be the the video of the episode in the background that you hardly even notice until the flock of Rodan's appear. It's just something
       about this opening that captivates you and holds your focus for every last second that it's there, and it doesn't do it with anything flashy, nor anything overly
       important even per se. It just holds you in the moment on the curiosity you have and the wonderful dialogue of the children.

    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:6%">An Old Man That Can See The Future</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Just as Goro had apparently predicted in the last episode a whole flock of Rodan is making its way to the mainland from the ocean. Steadily the pack makes its way
        inland to the metropolitan areas as crowds of people stand in awe at the monsters, who have seemingly changed form slightly. Their color is different and they seem
        slightly smaller, alongside that the radio also remarks that the Rodan seem quieter this time. With the Kaiju causing havoc in the city Outaki Factory springs into
        action with their scooter they modified to emit powerful radio waves to attract the beasts. Yun and Haberu hop on the scooter while Goro leads the charge in his car.
        Surprisingly, the radio antennas they added in the previous episode work on the Rodan as they attract a small group of them as test subjects. Unsurprisingly though they
        attract some unwanted guests as well that swoop from in front of them just as they're turning a corner. Attempting to out-speed this new group the trio floors it only to
        find an overturned bus in the road, forcing them to abruptly stop. Goro is able to brake safely but the scooter has troubles since it's a 3 wheeler and turns over, sending
        Yun and Haberu flying, causing Yun to hit his head off of the guard rail and render him unconscious.

        <p class = "gridPara mediumText">
          When Yun comes to the Rodan have already descended on the scene, with old man Goro making a run from his car to the safety of the bus. Haberu was already up and aware thankfully
          so he got Yun up on his feet as they make a run for a maintenance shed where a few others are already taking refuge. They make it in just in time as a Rodan slams into the door bending
          it inwards ever so slightly. With the gap in the door the Rodan places it head right up close and peers through in an amazingly creepy moment. The fidelity in the Rodan in this moment
          is incredible and the detail in the subtle movements of the eye during the closeup only helps make it that much scarier. While the group in the shed try to think of a way to get help the
          group of Rodan encroach on the bus and attempt to force their way in due to their attraction of the radio that's active in the bus. As the Rodan make their way into the bus Yun comes up
          with a plan involving a bow and some water bottles, not exactly something most would think of. Immediately he springs into action with some amazing math and science with the help of his AI.
          He begins looking into the screeches that the Rodan emit, remarking that they're a single octave higher than the reference tone of a human's. After simulating the water bottle in a
          wind tunnel of all things Yun begins to prepare it according to the specifications dictated by his AI. While in the midst of this we flash back to Goro and the other two aboard the bus
          about to fire off an arrow at the Rodan in an attempt of defence, but before Goro can fire, what sounds oddly similar to the screech of a Rodan is heard, taking the attention
          of the Rodan invading the bus. We soon find out that it's the bow and water bottle making this sound. The water bottle is attached to an arrow which is shot by the student that was
          carrying it. An incredibly ingenuity and genius solution, they use the water bottle as a wind tunnel/collection for the wind and the bow and arrow to propel it. With the correct size of
          hole on the bottle and speed of the arrow they produce a sound similar to that of the screech of Rodan, successfully drawing them towards where the arrows landed. With their moments of
          safety Yun and Haberu make a run for the scooter and continue on their mission of luring the Rodan away from the city.

        While all this action and suspense is happening on Yun's side of the story, Mei is on her way to meet with Professor Li due to her interest in Mei's research papers. While on the train to her
        destination we get introduced to another aspect of the story, the Archetype particle. In the midst of undestanding it we're interrupted by the people on the train learning of the flock of Rodan.
        While this doesn't affect Mei greatly she ends up lending a helping hand to Yun while sending a robot to check on her laundry of all things. The robot ends of crossing paths with Yun and
        Haberu and helps distract some of the Rodan as they push onward. After the events of the Rodan flock are completed we come back to Mei who is meeting with a very charismatic journalist who
        serves as a middle man to invite Mei to a conference that Professor Li is holding. After their meeting Yun manages to get in contact with Mei to thank her for her intervention with the Rodan
        and the conversation begins to transition to the flower encased in a cube that Mei had received from the journalist. Thanks to Yun's knowledge Mei realizes that the flower inside exists in a
        way that isn't possible. Yun explains it to be the Archetype particle that Professer Li is researching. She asks for hints from him but all he gives her is a test to solve a string of characters.
        The overall nature of this archetype particle is unknown to us at the moment but it's clear that it does some really interesting stuff. Of course it also has something to do with the Kaiju
        as we're being told about it but just learning about it alone is going to be incredibly interesting given the mystery around it.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Oddly enough the Rodan come from underwater, as shown in the previous episode's ending yet they can exist and live without water. The peculiar part about this is their sudden deaths that haven't
        been able to be explained just yet. As the same as last episode the massive flock of Rodan that Yun and Haberu were luring away suddenly dropped dead, with no explanation. The science of the show
        attempts to rationalize and explain the phenomenon but all they manage to do is come up with more questions that of course are eaten up and skewed by social media. If anything, the answer to these
        Rodan lies in the deep waters where they came from, which is where the episode takes us to end. We climb aboard a submarine that's been monitoring the Rodan and are met with what sounds like a
        new Kaiju that can move at breakneck speeds underwater. While monitoring the creature it suddenly makes a b-line for the submarine. We get a look from the outside as the creature approaches the
        submarine, completely dwarfing it in size as we make out the head of the creature before being lost in a sea of red mist dirtying the water. Certainly an interesting ending to the episode. Once
        more we're bombarded with science and information about the creatures while at the same time being given some satisfying action and adventure in the series. It definitely isn't something you should
        be watching with your brain turned off but it might not be too binge-able or easy to watch for all with the amount of complex theory and science it throws at people, but for nerds these sorts of
        episodes are a paradise.
