    <h2 class="brightText">The Last Blue Sky</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      The episode begins with us following Aoi as she wanders through town past ever familiar buildings. For a moment she pauses to take in the view of the sky as it looks as if it were
      painted red with blood. Distracted by the color of the sky a man stumbles towards her before lunging forward revealing a set of startling fangs and crimson eyes. Before the vampire
      can do anything the sun swallows him in a ball of blue fire, taking with him several other people as the camera pans outwards. The few people that witnessed the event are all bewildered
      and doubt the moments that they had just experienced. It's here that we understand where the city stands on its vampire outbreak and how grave the situation has become. Before we can
      understand more of what just happened we meet up with Yamagami and Shutaro as they attempt to navigate the sewer system to make it back to HQ. During their walk to the headquarters
      they go back and forth on the nature of the vampire unit they witnessed earlier, wondering who their commander was and how much training they endured. Of course we know the answer but
      Code Zero does not, which is why Suwa and Takeuchi tailed the unit back to where they came from to find Nakajima presiding over the group of vampires that have been locked back into
      their metal boxes they appeared from. While investigating the boxes they're being stored in they find a single one empty, Suwa commenting that there are still vacancies in the unit. We
      next follow Nakajima who finds himself aside Rufus in the facility that Misaki was once held in, casting aside all doubt that the two weren't working together to some degree. In their
      conversation we find out that Rufus was the one that set up the event for Nakajima to use to display the power of his vampire unit, causing their two stories to intertwine further.

        <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:10%">A Reprieve From Vampires</h2>
        <p>
          At just over six minutes in we're given a break from conversing with vampires as we meet once more with Aoi as she goes over articles that lay in front of her. As she talks about her
          articles, Aoi's boss tells her he's heading for Yokohama as he says it was the site of a large riot that had to be shut down by the army. While casually packing his bag he places some
          garlic and a cross in and comments on the fact that he's heard rumours that there were vampires at the riot. In the excitement of hearing such a sensational comment Aoi attempts to go with
          her boss but is denied as she has work that has to be completed. With the conversation finished we catch up with the pair of vampires making their way through the sewers as they finally make
          it to Maeda, though Shutaro comments on how quiet it is at HQ before we come back to Aoi and her boss. In a turn of events the boss comes back from Yokohama adamant that vampires were the
          cause of the riot, even handing Aoi an envelope containing some information. The two are also able to piece together the fact that the vampires have some role to play in the human combustion
          that Aoi had seen at the start of the episode. After agreeing on the course of action the boss claims that their newspaper will be a vampire newspaper, but that Aoi will have to hand him a
          vampire first. You can't very well run outright lies in the newspaper without proper evidence to back it up, right?

    <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">All In The Open</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p class = "mediumText">
        With Yamagami and Shutaro safely back at HQ and Maeda waiting for them, the group has a lot of information to cover and share with one another, and on queue Shutaro picks up the sound of Lt.
        Nakajima arriving. The 4 meet in the main area of Code Zero HQ as Nakajima stands with his back facing the other 3 while Yamagami politely questions him. It's here that Nakajima admits that the
        vampire unit is his. Shutaro interjects to ask Nakajima exactly who the vampire units are, causing Nakajima to dive deeply into his reasoning for creating a vampire unit. Nakajima's logic is that
        for no one to be die on the battlefield all his soldiers would simply just have to have an immortal body, and to achieve this he began artificially creating vampires, largely in thanks to help
        from Rufus. In front of Code Zero he produces a bottle of Ascra claiming that it's how he created the vampires for his unit, shocking Yamagami and Shutaro. As he continues to give them information
        it's discovered that the vampire unit that was seen was the entirety of the Special Forces Unit 16, as they'd all be transformed into vampires. Still taken aback by Nakajima's comments they're
        further shocked to find out that Maeda is to be the commander of this vampire unit, a fitting fate for the man that wants no one else to be the monster. We also get to confirm something as Maeda
        begins to speak, it was his life that Nakajima saved on the battlefield, and most likely that same fight that cost him his hand. Here we get to see Maeda's dedication to both the man who saved his
        life and his mission. There's no going back, that we know of, from being a vampire, and there's countless drawbacks yet he still pushed forwards for the sake of his mission. A stubborn and dedicated
        man who wanted to see no more blood lost right up until the end. Before Maeda drinks the ascra talks with Nakajima about Misaki and that he must stop him, but nothing outwardly occurs during the
        conversation as it mostly serves to show the morals and ethics of each side. Neither man is thinking correctly per se but neither is wrong in their ideals and desires. Nakajima created an immortal
        fighting force so he won't lose a single man, it's not the wrong choice and will stop countless amounts of bloodshed, but at the same time forced men to reject their humanity and become something
        different. Maeda follows similar styling as he's been given the tools to do the right thing but his history and loyalty hinder him. It's hard to pick a side for who's correct even though you know
        who it is because the decisions that have lead to this point aren't objectively wrong, it's a morally grey area where no one can win.

      <p>
        After Nakajima's finished his conversation and left Yamagami and Shutaro attempt to stop Maeda from drinking the ascra, but only succeed in taking it away from him and results in Yamagami being stabbed
        by Maeda. While on the ground from the injury Yamagami attempts to talk some sense into Maeda as Shutaro looks on, but is interrupted by shaking all around them. An earthquake suddenly hits causing the
        needles on the clock on the wall to fall off, breaking a hole in the floor which Shutaro falls through. Maeda and Yamagami end up taking the brunt of the damage from the earthquake and get buried beneath
        the rubble. Yamagami effortlessly survives the earthquake but finds Maeda in worse condition, a piece of rebar having pierced through his abdomen and his lower body buried beneath the rubble. Whilst Yamagami
        removes the rubble from Maeda, Maeda talks to Yamagami about going out for drinks to remember that he's more interested in tempura. With the subject of conversation you immediately realize which path this
        scene is taking. While Maeda's pinned under the rubble he airs his few regrets he's had with Yamagami and reminisces over them as Yamagami continues to remove the rubble. On the second to last piece to move
        out of the way Yamagami opens up a shaft straight to the surface from which sunlight pours in, and you realize you were misled. Yamagami lifts the final piece of heavy concrete up and off of Maeda with a
        smile on his face and a speech full of hope and happiness as he walks into the sunlight to burn away. An awfully poetic end to the vampire Yamagami. His death serving as the epitome of humanity and a hopeful
        catalyst for Maeda to not give his up. The episode overall encroaches on territory where any answer the characters give is neither right or wrong and it becomes a fight for your identity and humanity. Centering
        around vampires it has accessed to these questions incredibly easily and doesn't hesitate to use them as was shown in this episode. Despite his dealings with Code Zero earlier on when Maeda's mission calls for
        it he completely discards the vampires he was working with, only to realize his mistake in the final moments of his comrade. An incredibly poetic episode that fits perfectly with its heritage in theater.
