    <h2 class="brightText">A Blast From The Past</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      Episode 7's beginning can be a bit jarring since episode 6 finished on the cliffhanger of Yamagami dying and Maeda being confronted by Defrott. Rather than continue with the momentum it's
      produced it severs this story but inserting a flashback episode. It's a very risky decision considering the nature of modern anime but I think it was pulled off quite well. The episode follows
      a younger Misaki for the the most part but we also get to see a bit of Shutaro and Aoi, as well as Defrott of course. The flashback episode is execute so well that it feels like it slots perfectly
      into place, despite my earlier comments about it being a bump in the road of a smooth plot. The time we spend with Misaki is arguably mostly pointless as she's no longer a part of the story, but
      the interactions she has with people like Defrott and her father help paint a better picture of their personalities and how they've changed over time.
    </p>
    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:10%">An Ever Widening Rift</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Despite the beauty that episode 7 bestows upon us in the acting of characters like Misaki or Defrott, the real focus is the relationships between several characters. The first, and arguably most
        important to the story is the relationship between Misaki and her father. We follow Misaki for a long time as she pursues her dream of being an actress, while not taking advantage of her father's
        position. It's only halfway through the episode the true colors show as she brings back a series of letters to the theater that she picked up from home. As soon as Defrott asks about them Misaki's
        attitude drastically changes, waning from happy and enthusiastic to melancholic and solemn. Further into the episode we get our first, and only, interaction between Misaki and her father. Despite her
        success and popularity Nakajima behaves the same as always. Misaki however changes drastically from what we've seen this episode. She wears a kimono (or yukata, not sure what season they're in at this
        point in time) rather than her usual more modern clothing we've seen her in. Her demeanor changes to be more submissive than normal, her vocabulary more formal. The only thing that breaks this character
        she's playing is hearing that Maeda will be returning soon, to which she begins to smile and blush.

        Episode 7 largely revolves around theater, in specific the Imperial Theater. Though the show is undoubtedly about vampires they still manage to find ways to insert plenty of references to theater, and despite
        the two having nothing to do with each other on paper the pairing of it works quite well considering the overall styling of the show. The wide aspect ratio with black bars, the few and static backgrounds,
        the lack of super fast paced action. All of these are staples (or limitations you might say) of proper theater, so having this style and referencing theater directly in the show don't feel opposed at all. There's
        so much beauty in the scenery, so many subtle movements and ideas, so many unique angles to pursue characters from. It's a near endless fountain of uniqueness in a genre that has thrived off of tropes and cliches.
        Getting to see Misaki play Salome, Defrott acting out his various roles, seeing the overlap and inspiration in dialogue from various theater plays, not to mention even the foreshadowing by taking concepts from
        previous plays. It's possible to see Mars Red as two separate pieces put together, the vampire side of the story and theater side of the story but it's just wrong to think that. The two are so tightly intertwined
        that it's impossible to separate the theater from vampires and vice versa. The way characters like Defrott and Maeda act, the visuals we're given, everything is meant to be reminiscent of theater but at the same
        presents itself as an anime. The slow paced shots, the focus on the character and their dialogue rather than the animation, there's so many intentional creative choices to bring this show as close to theater as
        possible while still making it an enjoyable watch as an anime, and they've really highlighted it this episode. Not only is the styling akin to theater but the content as well. The flashback contains many climatic
        and important moments that are staples in theater. The childhood friends saying goodbye to one another as the young man goes off to war. The woman with a head full of dreams confronting her cold and distant father.
        The hero in a moment of desperation and despair. It's a massive culmination of everything amazing about theater and given to viewers in an easily accessible format. You don't have to spend 4 hours in a building
        watching people play it out all at once, we're given 20 minute bites of this play in a medium that we can enjoy in our own home. Mars Red feels like it's trying to bring theater into the mainstream for its viewers,
        and while it might not catch on with everyone it's a valiant effort to encourage more people to enjoy different content, while at the same time producing something that has the opportunity to be popular in modern anime.

        Defrott as we know him before this episode is a charismatic and charming "young" man that's a wildly popular actor in the Imperial Theater. He's very comfortable in talking with others and is relatively polite.
        Surprisingly Defrott doesn't start out like this, in his first encounter with Misaki he's very cold and crass to her refusing to have interest in talking with her. Rather than avoid her barrage of questions he makes
        his way to the stage to rehearse. Misaki follows in tail and watches on as Defrott delivers some wonderful lines. In his acting his personality completely changes, the Defrott we know is back as he's full of charisma
        and emotion while he practices. He becomes an entirely different person as soon as he sets foot on stage, but as quickly as he shifted his nature he reverts back. It takes Misaki a long time to get Defrott to even properly
        talk to her, but slowly he begins to open up. Their first notable conversations are Misaki offering Defrott food and him declining, for obvious reasons. The conversation however comes back to theater as Misaki shows off
        her acting for her part in Salome. Defrott quickly disregards her rehearsal as false, and gives her some very important tips for playing the part. Misaki picks up on it immediately and delivers an amazing rendition of
        Salome, completely captivating Defrott. After seeing Misaki's ability he warms up to her even further, becoming more candid and interested in talking. In the ending minutes of the episode we get to see Misaki's final
        rehearsal. The music immediately picks up as a choir joins in for what is a bone chilling moment. Knowing what's to happen but not being able to take your eyes off of the performance is exactly how Defrott feels as well.
        He watches on with a look of disbelief in his eyes as Misaki rehearses the famous lines of Salome. As a side note to this piece, you might have realized that all of the movements of Misaki are the exact same as the ones
        in her vampire state at the beginning of the show, a pretty neat detail. Moving forward however, Defrott remains frozen in place by Misaki's acting, even after Misaki is pinned under the rubble of the set. Only after everyone's
        rushed off does Defrott makes his way to the stage in an attempt to save Misaki. Feeling pity for her unfinished wish he offers Misaki some of his blood.

        Episode 7 ends the same way that it started, Defrott staring Maeda down as he's pinned to the rubble by a piece of rebar that had pierced through him. For the first time in the series we hear proper emotion in Defrott's voice.
        His frustration at seeing the high and mighty Maeda behave so weakly, seeing Misaki's last wish and hope fizzle out before his eyes is enough to enrage him. He doesn't want to save Maeda in particular, but refuses to let Misaki's
        hard work and hopes be cast aside so effortlessly. In the end we see Defrott raise his hand and clench his fist, the same style motion as when he offered his blood to Misaki. Here however, his hand begins to shake before we cut
        to a dark background to witness a ripple spread across it, as the episode ends with it. This episode was something very special, and follows the same kind of hopes I had voiced in my review of episode 7 of Shadows House previously.
        Mars Red doesn't follow the trend of fast paced action every episode, or over the top comedy, or bombarding the viewer with plot information and theories. It coasts along at the pace of its characters and provides a well fleshed
        out story that doesn't rely on flashy gimmicks or incredible action to draw attention and episode 7 embodies this. We're taken back to a slower time in the show and given time to spend with various characters to better understand
        them. It doesn't serve any sort of incredible purpose to the plot, nor give us incredibly important information that we didn't already know. But it isn't a waste of an episode either, so much content of interest is shown and we're
        not simply given the bare minimum to complete the characterization of someone. It's not as "normal" as Shadows House but it fits a similar purpose in this season's anime. It's not there to try and get as many viewers and rake in
        as much money as possible, it's there to tell a story and is fully committed to telling it above all other aspects of anime. Having ties to theater brings Mars Red even closer to its goal while giving it something to separate
        it from the rest of the pack, and episode 7 continues proves this.
