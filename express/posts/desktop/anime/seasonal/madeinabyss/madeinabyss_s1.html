          Made In Abyss has some of the best worldbuilding in an anime bar none, and it makes sense why. Its whole story revolves around exploring the Abyss, a bottomless pit full of mysteries and artifacts of
          the past. Of course there’d have to be a good world built around a story like that. It adds an incredible sense of wonder, but also one of fear and even horror, which brings us to the next thing. If
          you can’t stomach violent or gory events, psychological horror/terror, existential dread, etc. etc. this won’t be for you. I don’t want to spoil anything but it’s hard not to give that sort of warning,
          and that style of content will be talked about later as it plays a key role in the series. So, if you want to go in completely blind then go for it. It’s a great series that tackles a lot of messed up
          things that will have you feeling all sorts of ways, from shivering in fear, to crying your eyes out. If you need a bit more to see if it’s for you though, I hope I can explain a bit more of the series
          here and why it’s so good without tipping you off too much.

        </div>
        <p>
          Now, plenty of series have had some incredible worldbuilding or great aspects of depth and quality to them. The Video Game World Isekais, some more of the modern Shounen battle systems, endless expanses
          like Cowboy Bebop. There’s plenty of series that have come before that have done much of what Made In Abyss has done with its world, but none have done all of what this has. It has the incredible depth and
          thought that you’ll see in fighting systems like Jujutsu Kaisen, the wonderful expanse of untold knowledge and history that you’ll encounter in Cowboy Bebop, and a rich and full history and background like
          Video Game Isekais might. It envelopes you in a world of incredible discoveries but manages to show how many secrets the Abyss yet holds. The history of the city of Ortho, which surrounds the Abyss maintains
          that same level of quality as well, and the present world keeps pace. Adventurers aren’t what you’d call few and far between, and other cities and countries attempt to take the Abyss for their own, it’s heralded
          as a city of heroes, a spelunker's paradise. On the flip side though, there’s run down districts where the poor who can’t live the life that the Abyss dictates preside, there’s orphanages for the children of
          divers that haven’t made the climb back. There’s even festivals and ceremonies that glorify the lives of those lost to the Abyss. The concept of living around a vast pit of culture and history was used with incredible
          thought and thus the author managed to incorporate every single important aspect of worldbuilding into his story. There’s level
          systems, there’s historical connections, if you name it there’s probably some form of it in Made In Abyss. One of the most important pieces of the worldbuilding has in actuality been the visuals of this series. Having
          the notes to back it up, the scenes that Made In Abyss paints are exceedingly beautiful, though sometimes disturbing.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Having such a rich bank of information to pull from, Made In Abyss manages some absolutely awe-inspiring
        moments with the creativity of the author paired with the ability of the artists. Incredible caverns that go on forever, foreign species that most would never even conceive as a possibility, all manner of terrible
        creatures and stories of the past. The worldbuilding doesn’t simply rely on its characters or story to prove itself, but is shown in its countless designs as well. All sorts of intricate contraptions and puzzle pieces
        strewn about in the world that tell their own story without words or attention. Oddly designed places that fit perfectly into the world, the best example being the orphanage that our main character Riko lives in. The
        classroom that they teach in being rather shallow where students have to climb up the wall into their seats, a perfect example of the culture of Orth being influenced by the Abyss. Every aspect of this story is so well
        influenced by the history that the world’s been given that there’s hardly a single piece you can point out and be confused about. There’s just the right amount of mystery to replace doubt with confusion, but eventual
        acceptance. In a story where the world matters most, Made In Abyss certainly gives it the attention that it's due.

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Visuals And Characters Versus Story</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The largest dichotomy of the series is certainly between what is presented and used, and what is achieved. The series itself looks very cute and quaint, a feeling of wonder covering the Abyss. The main character,
        who’s an orphan always being positive and happy, sporting an unending desire to explore the depths of the Abyss and discover what happened to her mother. *Some* characters, and *some* visuals go directly against what’s
        going on though and play right into the hands of the story. Unnerving moments full of despair, scenes that force you to question the humanity present in the Abyss, there’s no shortage of pieces in this show that make
        you question what exactly it is. The basis of the story is a girl, Riko, and the robotic boy that she finds, Reg, are venturing deep into the Abyss to find out about Riko’s mother after her whistle makes it to the surface
        one day with several bundles of notes attached. It starts off pretty happy and warm as you’d expect, but every so often something’s thrown in to make you doubt what’s going on, the Abyss being the perfect conduit for
        those switches. The frequency and, arguably, the intensity of these moments increases as the pair move further and further into the massive hole. It’s a wonderful bit of writing that makes use of the characters and their
        dispositions, and the art style which comes off as something very cute and disarming. The story itself though, very rarely shrouds itself in the same way that the visuals and characters do. From the beginning it gives
        off a very grim air along with its world, but it’s drowned out by the hope of the characters and the wonderful scenery. It’s only until you fully experience the dread that Made In Abyss can produce that you learn to be
        on edge, but even that doesn’t do much. The story well and truly is the opposite of what’s presented at a glance most of the time. There’s no shortage of death and violence and horror that get swept under the rug in this
        journey, and no matter how much of it you experience, the prior moments will never prepare you for what’s to come. The raw emotion in these terrible scenes is overpowering, not allowing you to process it properly. You
        don’t get plenty of time to take in what’s happened, and nothing ever goes over smoothly. It’s one stumble after the next through the horrors of the Abyss in which even Riko isn’t unwavering. It’s a glorious mess that
        will have you feeling at your lowest with each moment as the characters dive deeper and deeper, and uncover stories that you wouldn’t even think possible for a human to cook up. Of course though, the characters and the
        visuals to accompany will always try to disarm those feelings, and sometimes they will, but it’s not a guarantee. Horror and happiness go hand in hand in this show, and are typically split between the story and its
        inhabitants, creating a warm attachment to all the people of its world only to use that connection to do harm.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The nature of the majority of Made In Abyss is to be contradictory. It’s visuals and characters oppose its story as I had shown, but even within those aspects the differences go deeper. It’s a story about children going through
        incredibly terrible trials for a single goal. Typically something we’ve seen in countless anime but few make it as realistic and candid as Made In Abyss, and even fewer use an art style that paints them as even more childish and
        innocent. These are children exploring an unknown world that has murdered innumerable amounts of people throughout the annals of history. Everything born from the Abyss possessing traits that are meant for the express purpose for
        a violent survival in a horrible place. There’s a huge disparity in what’s happening and how it should be happening. The pairings just don’t match up, friendship is shattered, hopes dashed, hearts and minds and souls broken like
        someone was snapping their fingers. No matter how you look at it hardly any piece adds up with the next, but that’s what makes for its charm. Rather than building something that keeps you on edge there’s countless pieces that are
        there to sooth your heart and mind, and distract you from the reality of the situation. You feel hope and excitement as the characters struggle to survive, happiness over seeing them share a pitiful meal, peace and acceptance at
        the loss of lives. The contradictions have been expertfully placed to make sure that you have the “worst” experience possible, that is to say that they are used to ensure that you try to stay on edge for all the things that may
        happen but end up being comforted by a series of more calming scenes and interactions before being thrust into it. The ability to mix these two aspects together so well is an imperative part of the success of Made In Abyss and is
        what makes it such a great show to watch.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Made In Abyss is a very hard series to explain fairly without spoiling its content or style, but even knowing what it’s like going in won’t be able to prepare you for what it unleashes. It’s a realistic story in the way that everything
        that can go wrong, will go wrong, and that loss and horror and fear are normal aspects of its story. Its world created with the express purpose of being both beautiful and terrifying, and a story that makes full use of what it’s been
        created within. It’s an incredibly emotional journey of an orphaned child descending into the Abyss to find out if her Mother really is waiting for her at the bottom, and the story of finding where the robotic child Reg belongs and where
        he came from. Using children as its vessel for the story allows for those moments of emotion to be heightened, making for an experience that would be decidedly different if it were to follow older characters. Made In Abyss leaves you
        feeling nearly hollow after experiencing its story (including the movie), but in an almost good way. It feels like being able to let everything out after being pent up for so long, almost a feeling of relief by the end of it. Each horrible
        moment being used as a reset button to recenter your perspective on the show and prove what the lowest points of humanity can produce. It’s something that takes an incredible mind to think up, as none of its darker parts are there for the
        sake of being dark, but for the sake of being human. In the end, that’s what it feels like. A series that speaks about humanity in a fantastical sense. The incredible desires to press on despite everything falling apart, holding onto hope
        in the darkest of nights, the hopelessness and doubts in front of an insurmountable road block, terror and fear at the simplest of things, hesitation in front of doing the right thing, doing whatever it takes to move forward. Made In Abyss
        personifies humanity in all of what it does between its highs and lows, and makes for something that feels the closest to truly human that you might get in a series like this.
