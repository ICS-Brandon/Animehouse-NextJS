          Brand New Animal is a bit of an oddball in terms of what it is. It follows the lives of anthropomorphic animals that live in a mega city of their own away from the rest of humanity. The first odd thing
          would be the Anthropomorphic animals, but we’ve had that in series like Odd Taxi and Beastars now, and they don’t explore any of the more explicit connections between human and animal in terms of nature,
          but rather the more complex and personal ones. It also follows quite a few tropes and repetitions that add a very odd sense of style to the show, it’s certainly not the most standard thing out there, so
          if you’re not overly interested in some slightly more weird or experimental stuff then you won’t really enjoy BNA. On the other hand though if you like really unique styling in terms of art, animation,
          and music then Brand New Animal can definitely scratch that itch. It tells a story that can be fairly standard in media but makes use of a very interesting lens through which we see, and pairs it with
          a sense of style that adds a bit of a veil to the content so that it doesn’t feel like it’s staring you right in the face all the time. The end product becomes something that can be both critical,
          meaningful, and thoughtful or just a very cool 12 episode series with some great style to separate it from the pack.
        </p>

    <div>
      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Style Dancing With Substance</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The style and content of Brand New Animal intertwine with each other constantly, coming so close to being one at points and at others opposing each other or inhabiting opposites. BNA is a bright and neon world
        filled with wonder and excitement and all sorts of incredible moments, but within those moments the story can sometimes call for some darker things. The case and point would be the very first episode when our
        main character Michiru is being hunted down by a bunch of humans for being a beastman, the name for the anthropomorphic humans of this series. The worst of course doesn’t come to pass, but the insinuation of
        what might happen to Michiru remains grim and dark within the story. Before anything terrible can happen a certain crew steps in to save Michiru, and brings her to the city of Beastmean, Anima City. These
        moments following the opening dispel the tension that appeared as Michiru arrives in the midst of a massive festival in Anima City. All sorts of beastmen celebrating and having a good time in a world that’s
        their own, free from the discrimination of the outside world. Not only do the visuals play back and forth with the story, but the music too, adding a very unique vibe to countless moments throughout. The most
        apt way to describe the soundtrack would be ‘experimental’, there’s such a vast range of styles and types of music that it’s impossible to properly categorize it, and that works perfectly to explain the story
        of Brand New Animal as well. Just like the music the story is all over the place, darting from one thing to the next inbetween the major aspects that it wants to cover. Throughout these smaller pieces however,
        much of the sentiment of the show remains in the smaller moments thanks to the art and music of the show. It’s this sort of dance between what it wants to tell and what it shows, where at each level it says one
        thing and then another says the next. The show dedicates itself to making a cohesive product out of every aspect, and creates a very layered approach to its storytelling that allows for it to be either enjoyed
        as a simple good looking anime, or as something more valuable and meaningful.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Brand New Animal uses animals for a very obvious reason, and the reason is certainly valid. It’s not hard to realize that mostly whenever anthropomorphic animals are used in media it’s usually for harsher critique
        of humanity that would feel uncomfortable or too direct when using actual people. BNA realizes this as many other series do and makes use of animals in some ways that get very close to crossing the line. The very
        first opening of the series being one of those moments, despite distancing itself from humanity for the majority of the show it has absolutely no issue with tackling issues like xenophobia, racism, etc. It doesn’t
        even try to sugar coat it in any fancy way, the humans are malicious towards the beastmen, they wear masks to curry favor with them, even their own act as traitors. Brand New Animal doesn’t just use its beastman
        to distance themselves from the harsher commentary about humans though, but also uses it to help visualize some of the more personal aspects of the story. Anima City is shown as some sort of Utopia to all incoming
        beastman that can make it there, a safe haven where they can live their lives freely and openly, but as Michiru spends more time there she begins to realize that it’s not the case. Anima City can be, and will be,
        just as cruel as the rest of humanity. Beastmen will take advantage of you, they’ll do horrible things for personal gain, they’ll fight against their fellow Beastman. While it might not be the intention of the show,
        it’s hard not to draw the conclusion from BNA that no matter where you end up in life, the world will still remain cruel to you. The horrible nature of humanity isn’t just limited to those in your immediate vicinity.
        At the same time though, the kindness that you can find elsewhere can be just as valuable as that of what you know. Michiru makes countless friends within Anima City that take care of her and make her happy that it’s
        been an experience in her life, and play a major role in her accepting herself as she is now.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        For the most part I’ve been talking about a human’s perspective looking into Anima City, but BNA also gives a peek into a Beastman’s perspective of life outside of the shell. Anima City is the only safe place on Earth
        for Beastmen of course, but that doesn’t mean that the outside believes all of that. There are humans out there that accept beastmen and want to allow them normal lives, and we see an attempt of that with Michiru and one
        of her friends from later on in the series, Nina. The pair go to a human party where they initially feel accepted for their beastman traits, but quickly that falls apart. It’s not because of malicious intention or
        rudeness, but rather fascination and fetishization of Beastmen as a whole. They encourage Nina to do party tricks, they crowd her over her appearance and bombard her with all sorts of questions. They don’t do it out of
        rudeness, but it’s rude and inconsiderate regardless. There’s so many examples of this sort of inappropriate fascination and interest in other races in reality that it’s hard to not winge a little when watching, but it’s
        what BNA wants to do. It wants to tell a story that covers all sorts of topics *like* racism and xenophobia, and uses the lens of Beastmen to do so in a way that’s easy to understand but allows for its content to be
        critical and realistic, without being too hard to watch.

    <div>
      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Repetition Done Right</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Repetition plays a rather large role in the story of Brand New Animal, and for a good few reasons. One of the simplest reasons is that the repetition is used to show how much Michiru looks up to Shirou throughout the story,
        each having their own catchphrases and fight ending moves they pull out each and every time. In her own way, Michiru is mimicking Shirou and looking up to him as a role model in the story in this way, and while it’s not an
        important aspect in terms of showing how much Michiru looks up to Shirou it’s an interesting way to tie it into the story under the surface with some added flair. Another piece where repetition becomes important is in those
        same moments of combat, both for Michiru and Shirou. For the majority of the series the pair end their fights in the same ways with the same finishing lines, in what might seem nearly boring. As we make our way to the end
        though, these aspects change and grow, which begs viewers to draw a connection between it. That connection being the personal development of both of the characters and how they view themselves. Shirou paints himself in a
        box due to his history and life, and Michiru as well because she doesn’t fully accept herself as she is currently. Over the course of the series though these thoughts change and so do their actions, effectively opening the
        box that each had confined themselves to. The repetition of their actions isn’t purely used for style, but also helps to show the characters and their growth and acceptance of their current selves.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Odds And Ends</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        There’s a few things in Brand New Animal that I enjoyed and want to talk about but don’t quite fit into a paragraph of their own, so I’ve stuffed them into this little spot. The first is the concept of religion within Anima City.
        At first religion isn’t something that’s really considered in its history, but towards the end a religious cult of beastmen makes ground in Anima City and things start to fall apart. The religion causes countless issues in the city
        and even plays a role in its attempted destruction. Very obviously the show has a disdain for religious aspects, though not of religion as a whole. Shirou himself is viewed as a religious figure, and the ultimate bad guy as well.
        Instead I think it shows a desire to cling to faith in the face of adversity. Michiru’s friend was lost and hopeless and couldn’t accept herself, but (almost) found the answer through religion. The people of Anima City needed a God
        to protect them from the horrors of humanity, so Shirou Ogami is given that role (though the citizens don’t know its him). The purebloods of Beastmen history declare themselves Gods in the face of the abysmal impurity found in cities
        of old. There’s plenty of pieces in the show that carry religious tones, and most of the time it’s a negative aspect, but it doesn’t attack religion directly. Instead, it shows the difficulties of faith in desperation and not in
        strength and how easily institutions will be used for personal gain and assertion of power.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Also, for the keen readers that know a bit of Japanese there’s a fun little connection with Shirou’s name. First of all, his first name takes from ‘White’ which can be inferred in this context to be something along the lines of ‘pure’
        (meant to be a bit satirical given how he came to get his powers), and his last name ‘Ogami’ very clearly is taken from ‘Wolf’ (Okami, in  Japanese the second character of a word can have its first letter changed, kami -> gami). So
        Shirou’s name is, in effect, White Wolf, but within the Japanese word for Wolf resides ‘Kami’. It can mean things like paper, hair, and even God, which is funny as we basically had the story of Shirou sitting in front of us from the
        get go. Moving on from Religion, Brand New Animal also makes a small bit of commentary on war and some of the challenges of being nomadic in nature with an Albatross character. Once more it’s a very sharp commentary, but this time
        doesn’t hold anything back. It lays it all bare in an interesting concept and even talks about the troubles of living as a nomad. It’s a very small piece of the puzzle in the grand scheme of background themes in the show like poverty
        and how disadvantaged populations are easily taken advantage of, or the predatory nature of seeking salvation, but it fits in very well as it matches the overall commentary of critique of humanity and society. In the end, there’s dozens
        of smaller themes and pieces that fit under that umbrella of a critical look at humans and society, but what makes it accurate and worthwhile is that it’s not thrown in your face. Instead it’s given a role in the background that plays
        second fiddle to the main story and shows what the world is like without throwing it in your face, because reality doesn’t show you what’s wrong with itself either.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Brand New Animal sets out to do two things. The first, tell a story of self-love and acceptance and learning to be happy in your own skin no matter what happens. And second, to give a sharp commentary of humans and society that wears a
        *very* thin mask of using Beastmen for its commentary. The story of self-acceptance and love is most definitely the more important aspect of the story, and is what we largely follow. Michiru’s journey is a challenging one to watch but
        gives many important lessons to viewers about accepting who they are and not trying to force change or refute it, but rather flow with it and enjoy what comes. Throughout Michiru’s journey though she’s reminded of the challenges of society
        and that even if you love yourself, the people around you might not. Through that lens we see how terrible that people and society can be, which brings us to a sharper critique than expected in a series about personal growth and loving
        yourself. Brand New Animal becomes something very unique, as its art style and music seem to promise, and makes for a very interesting watch. The messages and commentaries are of course important and well thought out, but even if you miss
        them or already understand all of what it wants to say it can easily stand as an amusing series with its catchphrases, action sequences, art and animation, and music. There’s several ways to enjoy Brand New Animal, each way catering to a
        specific demographic so that everyone can get something out of watching it.
