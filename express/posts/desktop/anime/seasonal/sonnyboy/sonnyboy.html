        <p>
          In simplest terms, Sonny Boy will not easily answer any of the questions you have, it will not give you a happy ending that you want, and it will not make sense easily. What it will do though is provide
          countless unique perspectives into the development of youths, include complex commentary and stories on a range of topics like life and death, and create something so wildly unique that every episode
          will stick out in your memory. If you’re not interested in unique perspectives showcasing and critiquing society and humanity it’s best to just walk away from Sonny Boy. It’s not something that everyone
          will enjoy, and even encroaches on niche content as it takes incredibly different approaches to telling its stories. It ends up being something that’s personal to those that watch it, as everyone’s
          experience is different from the next, but requires an open mind to fully appreciate. It’s also a series that definitely needs more than one watch to properly understand. There’s so much information and
          symbolism and meaning in every aspect of the show that it’s just impossible to catch in a single watch. In a sea of mindless watches each season that can be painfully forgettable, Sonny Boy tries it’s
          absolute hardest to break away from everything else out there. So, if you don’t want to dedicate the time and focus to the series you’re going to walk away disappointed instead of indifferent, so try to
          wait until you’re ready and willing to give it what it needs to be a good show.
        </p>

    <div>
      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Don’t Try To Understand</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        This title might be a bit confusing but allow me to explain. Sonny Boy is an incredibly convoluted story, told through multiple characters and countless worlds. It leaves loose ends, it has cliff hangers
        that are not resolved, it leaves things to your imagination. Sonny Boy isn’t something that’s explicitly meant to be understood, but rather experienced. Understanding will stem from experience, but attempting
        to go the other way around will only induce headaches. The only people to truly understand Sonny Boy in the “correct” way are the people that are involved with it. That’s because of what I said in the previous
        paragraph, everyone’s experience is different. Your views on each topic will be different than someone else’s, and that difference will result in a different understanding of what’s going on. Forcing yourself
        to understand what’s going on takes away your unique perspective of the series and in a way removes the value in watching Sonny Boy. The whole point is personal development and understanding (for the main
        character Nagara), and trying to objectively understand the points it covers makes it pointless. Your ideas about toxic workplaces and ethics are different than others, your limits are different than others,
        what you will take away from Sonny Boy *Will Be Different From Others*.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        All of this isn’t to say that you’re not allowed to understand Sonny Boy at all, there’s plenty of areas that require understanding but those aren’t the core of the series. You have to understand what’s happening to
        some degree to be able to experience it, so trying to understand what the story is attempting to do is fine, it’s the reading between the lines that becomes an issue. Watching an episode and trying to understand what
        it’s topic is, or what’s happening between two characters is normal. It’s when you try to understand what’s happening *between* the interactions of those two characters and find what exactly it is, rather than taking
        what you’re given and having your own opinion on it that it starts to lose value. Understanding versus Experiencing Sonny Boy is like the difference between theory and application. You can watch all the videos possible
        to find the perfect form for swinging a golf club, or you can learn by feel. There’s nothing inherently wrong with going the theory route, but doing what works for everyone else doesn’t mean it works for you. It might
        even feel wrong and awkward compared to going by feel. In feel, you might not reach the levels of perfection like you might with theory, but it feels right and comfortable. Sonny Boy doesn’t try to aim for perfection
        or some grand scheme of theorycraft behind its story, but instead something that feels right and becomes something different in the hands of each viewer.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Sonny Boy is an interesting series at the best of times, perplexing and confusing at worst. The constant among it all though is the grand scheme of things that it wants to go through. Right from the start it’s
        easy to tell that Sonny Boy takes an all encompassing theme of “Development In Society”. There’s so many different ways to break this archetype down into its smaller pieces that are displayed in this anime, but
        I’ll let the episodes do the talking on that. The early episodes have easily identifiable concepts stemming from this single sentence, covering things like Capitalism or innate talent versus burning desire. In
        the later episodes however, these themes become harder to pick out as we move into more complex settings and stories. There’s a steady incline to the obfuscation of what Sonny Boy is with each passing episode,
        blending more and more of itself together into a homogenous mixture of stories and characters that become harder and harder to differentiate. This complication, in and of itself, is an intentional aspect of
         Sonny Boy. Its world is dynamic, its characters static, their lives and moments frozen in time. Development though, is something that happens both within the dynamic nature of the many ‘This Worlds’ that are
         explored and inhabited by our static characters, who also undergo development in all sorts of odd manners.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Despite being frozen in time themselves, their “lives” move on in whichever world they settle, which helps place more focus on the development of the non-physical. Keeping themselves looking the same allows us to pay more
        attention to the things that have changed that you *can’t* see. Ever deepening concepts of life and death, friendship and sense of self, everything that resides in the mind of each individual changes while their exterior
        existence does not. Sonny Boy plays with the dials of time within its story so that it can give the viewers exactly what it wants to at each moment while still offering a main story that isn’t overly complex to the point
        where you can’t understand the order of events. It has countless branches that merge into the trunk of the story so that it’s given creative freedom but still creates something that at its very minimum, can be cohesive.
        It’s an odd thing to talk about the least that Sonny Boy can give, but it makes more sense than trying to explain thousands of years of development across innumerable time pockets and worlds within a single scope. If you
        have a hard time understanding all the time differences and thousands of years of gaps and unimaginable scenery, you can be promised that at the very least when you watch it for the first time you’ll at least have *some*
        understanding of what’s happening. It’s not an easy series to watch, but it tries its best to keep the minimum product of it somewhat straightforward. Even more surprising is that it’s able to keep its core relatively simple
        but interact with such complex moving parts and include fantastically complex conceptual items and experiences within what can seem simple on the surface.

      <p>
        Sonny Boy is absolutely rife with symbolism, it adds an incredible amount of unspoken depth to the show in countless ways, and acts as a door to a different experience. You can watch the whole show without understanding a lick
        of its symbolism and still walk away with something that resembles a show, or you can look for each piece and what it seems like to you and uncover an immense amount of unspoken stories within its world. One of my favorite episodes
        of the anime is one where for the majority of the episode it seems like the main story is just a symbol, until it inhabits their reality. This is to say, that the symbolism of Sonny Boy is in every aspect that you can find, the cracks
        and holes poked in the ‘This Worlds’, the actions and states of characters, the items discovered and the powers used (yeah, a little late but the characters all have super powers of one type or another), even the very fabric of the
        ‘This Worlds’ and the characters can be symbolism. Some of the symbolic nature of things is easier to find than others, the story even at times directly pointing it out, and other times it hides in the shadows and gaps where you’d
        never think to look. Some of the symbolism can explain even the most mundane of things, like an item that no matter what happens to it will stay as it is, forever unchanged. Other pieces of symbolism aim to tackle more complicated
        and less concrete things, like a Tower of Babel that’s built upside down, fated to never be finished. As is the case for the rest of Sonny Boy, its symbolism spans an incredible amount of mediums and manifests in all manner of ways.
        It’s up to the viewer to discover and come to their own conclusions though, as no one piece is ever fully explained. You’re given the option to uncover each piece, but what happens after that is up to you. What you take away from
        Sonny Boy’s symbolism entirely depends on yourself and your life. A sports jock that’s spent his life around athleticism will have an entirely different take than someone that’s found it more comfortable in the classroom. The
        experiences of each individual are different for life, and the same goes for Sonny Boy. It’s a show that means something to *you*, not to everyone.

        Sonny Boy is something infinitely hard to put into words, the majority of the show and what it wants to mean to each person is entirely unspoken. You can talk on end about all the pieces of symbolism it uses and what it means, or how
        deep the “lore” of the “This Worlds” go, you can craft all sorts of theories in the face of this monolithic story. The truth is though, that none of that matters. Your theories can be as correct or incorrect as you want for almost
        everything, you can dive into the rabbit hole and find the answer to the “This Worlds” or how students got their powers, or why God is the principal of a school. In the end Sonny Boy wants you to take away what you want, what you
        experience. It’s the story of personal development and growth alongside countless other blossoming stories. It shows things like mental illness, social standards and interactions, and all other manner of things. It's not a story with a
        single point, and while it may have a final message to leave you with, the journey from A to B is entirely yours. Sonny Boy ends up being a personal experience to everyone that watches it, to all the countless perspectives on its messages an
        equal amount of thoughts and takeaways are created. Is it easy to walk away with something profound and thought-provoking to yourself? … Not exactly no, it requires focus and interest in following something like this. You can still watch
        it half focused and have a good time because of the great visuals of it, or the crazy stuff that it produces, but choosing that over the former option wastes the majority of the potential of Sonny Boy. It’s something that’s meant to be
        focused on and to pick up on the little pieces and what they mean to you, and as the saying goes, the devil’s in the details. These smaller pieces of Sonny Boy are where the real defining factor of it resides, the unspoken moments, what
        each piece means to you, all of it is integral in what it’s able to allow you to experience. In the end, you’ll get out what you put in with Sonny Boy, so what you want from it is up to you.
