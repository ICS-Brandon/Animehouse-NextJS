    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          Before my typical blanket statement as to whether or not you should watch a show, I wanted to go over some different things for “Takt Op. Destiny”, as this is a special case compared to previous
          reviews of a given show. When you first watch “Takt Op. Destiny”, there’s a definite trace of passion and creativity within it. There’s a “loosely” true fairy tale explanation of the good and
          bad guys, and I enjoyed that it was slightly different from what reality truly was. There’s some great music and creative choices, as well as some incredible art and animation that gets paired
          with great cinematography and choreography. I was very surprised by this, given that it was: A) an anime original project, and B) a tie-in for a mobile game. The former didn’t surprise me as
          much as the latter, given that we’ve seen a few wonderful original anime series this year like Sonny Boy or Vivy, but the latter was quite interesting to see, due to the well deserved stigma
          surrounding anime adaptations of video games, which unfortunately seems to bare the same curse as live action adaptations of them as well. You might be reading this little introduction and be
          wondering why it needed a precursor, and we’ll sadly be getting to that now. “Takt Op. Destiny” exhibits one of the most glorious, flailing, and effortless failures of a middle and end that
          I’ve seen when compared to where it started. It was a painful experience to say the least, and is what some of the review will cover after an introduction to what made it so outstanding to
          begin with.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          If you have the willpower to be able to watch the first 3 episodes (some say 5 is the mark where it reaches the point of no return, but I personally prefer 3), then I can comfortably and
          confidently say you’re in for some of my favorite anime of 2021. It perfectly encapsulates everything that it wants to from its concept, and in wonderful fashion. Some truly great stuff
          in regards to music theory and relation, composer bias and personal attachment, character interaction and history, as well as some beautiful scenes and sequences as is expected of Mappa
          and Madhouse. If you aren’t comfortable with an unfinished story, “Takt Op. Destiny” isn’t worth your time or the rollercoaster of disappointment interspersed with false lights at the
          end of its various tunnels. After those first 3 episodes it decides to become purely an advertisement for the mobile game, and makes no effort to bring originality and uniqueness. It
          shamelessly shows off villains, Musicarts and abilities that make no sense, all for the sake of being able to say that they checked off certain boxes. A disappointment to say the
          least. The staff behind the series wasn’t star studded like some others, and what they had was a *very* large proving ground, but it’s seemingly been squashed in a defeated nature.
          It’s as if the hands behind the project began to make dolls out of the people that brought life to the early episodes. At the end of the day, the first few episodes represent what
          potential lies in original anime concepts, but the rest is a testament to the inherent danger of mixed media projects as corporate greed runs rampant. As a side note, perhaps the
          worst part of this entire ordeal, is that the mobile game that the anime is based off of has indefinitely been delayed. A symbolic final finger, slipping from the grasp “Takt Op.
          Destiny” had in holding onto any hope of redemption.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        In all manner of fashion, Takt showed off some incredibly impressive potential in its first three episodes. During those earlier moments, synchronization between Takt, our male main
        lead, and Destiny, the female Musicart under his control, plays an important role and is paralleled quite well within the pairing in all sorts of ways. Matching each other's melodies
        and feelings is apparently important to drawing out the power of the individuals as well, and as expected, the pairing is largely lacking, which makes sense considering how fresh
        they are to the notion. Early on though, there’s a few really great exemptions to this awkward nature. Among my favorite things of the early episodes was the composer bias seen with
        Takt, who certainly preferred Beethoven, as was evident by how many of his pieces are featured in the series. Destiny, his Musicart, was born from Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, also
        titled Destiny. It’s considered a cornerstone of Western classical music, and has highly important undertones within itself in regards to the story. There’s even some Tchaikovsky
        tossed in via a flashback of Takt’s father, which further lends credit to Takt’s composer bias in Beethoven, versus his father’s preference of Tchaikovsky. They even introduce some
        prohibition era music during a little festival since music’s been largely banned (I forgive the cliche D2 showing up for the fact that the music choice was solid and well executed).
        Even further down the music avenue, the sound design in regards to music was amazing as well. The first large scale fights of the series feature some wonderful stuff with an amped
        up 5th symphony, an interrupted Moonlight Sonata (which is actually under moonlight), and an original symphony style piece to boot. The point here should be pretty clear when I say
        that in these episodes they well and truly cared about the use of music and its value in telling the story of Takt and Destiny, as they attempt to make it to New York while fending
        off the D2, the Musicart’s opposition, along the way. Outside of that, the art and animation is as astounding as you’d expect it to be, and I especially loved the choreography and
        cinematography, as realism, linear scenes and sequences, and overwhelming logic weren’t given a second thought. It was meant to be beautiful, and was astonishingly so, and perfectly
        paralleled the music that played alongside it. It flowed and held value and wasn’t purely for the sake of the story, but rather the experience. And it was dazzling, satisfying,
        endlessly enjoyable, and exciting. I might also add that this doesn’t include any of the smaller moments that add plenty, such as Takt tapping away on various surfaces as he mimics
        playing a piano, or the audacious “Kuudere” that Destiny plays early on, bringing some nice dry humor to offset Takt’s colder disposition.

        You may think it’s confusing for this review to start with a forewarning about the series, only for it to be followed up with very high praise for its start. You’d be right for the
        most part, but I really wanted to drive home how enjoyable and great “Takt Op. Destiny’s” first leg was compared to the rest of it, which will begin to get outlined here. The methodical
        dismantling that takes place in the rest of the show is very hard to watch, especially after all they cultivated in that first hour of content. It easily becomes the antithesis to its
        earlier episodes, and continually does harm to every aspect of itself in such a meticulous manner. Just as you think things can’t get worse in a specific way, it's as if the show hears
        your pleas, and does so anyway. You can pray that the next Musicart you see isn’t a painfully one dimensional personality trope, but it will hear you, and give you another painfully one
        dimensional personality trope who plays no role in the story. You might hope that other Maestros and Musicarts will be of importance to the series, and “Takt Op. Destiny” will answer
        those hopes by making every other Maestro and Musicart obsolete. It manages to check every single box on the ‘con’ side and refuses to do anything on the ‘pro’ one. It throws reason to
        the wind and contradicts itself consistently each and every episode; creating threads of stories and plots that seem like they might be important, but either conclude them faster than
        you can comprehend, or refuse to even touch on their existence. It’s endlessly frustrating, and something <a href = "https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=428025" target = "blank">I’ve already talked about in great detail over on My Anime List</a>, so I will spare
        the details of this awful nature and keep it succinct. “Takt Op. Destiny” feels like it’s been manufactured purely to spite the fans of its early episodes. Some can argue that even the
        animation has gone downhill in the later episodes, though this is mostly due to fight choreography, as style is replaced by devastating power that occupies the majority of the screen.
        It’s an advertisement for over the top action that will be apparent in the yet-to-be-released mobile game, that completely forgoes all the great work put in at the beginning. Its
        characters are meant to capture the most base of reactions and desires via their cookie cutter personalities, so that each individual can successfully self-insert into this story,
        and play out their fantasies à la dating sim. The music is simply used to fill the empty space and pull on heartstrings established in earlier episodes. Hardly a new piece is introduced
        after episode 3 that fits its scene and grabs your attention. The story doesn’t even know what it’s doing other than where it must end up. Despite knowing where it has to finish, and
        having the ability to string any number of things together, it decides that it should take the worst and most incoherent route possible. The combat system falls entirely apart as music
        and harmony no longer play a role in combat power and capability. The hordes of stereotypical enemies manage to earn a title even lower than the aforementioned one given to them,
        becoming purely a plot device that ignores all of its previously established reasoning. I could go on endlessly, I could even create an entire series of essays on the failures and
        shortcomings of the show, but I think this outline serves as enough of a deterrent to most readers.

        “Takt Op. Destiny” wasn’t bad from the start, it wasn’t, no matter how harshly you look back at it. And that makes this far worse. You can’t just say that it didn’t have potential, that
        it wasn’t a great series at one point early on, because it undoubtedly was. Being so good, and spiraling so spectacularly down into despair, caused it to impressively fail; making this
        one of the most disappointing and hardest anime experiences of 2021 for me. You can pretend it doesn’t exist like other shows, but then you neglect its electric start. You can ridicule
        its later episodes, but that doesn’t soothe the pain of betrayal from the earlier ones. It’s this painful trap where you want to give credit to the highly enjoyable first 3 viewings, but
        wish to disown the rest of the series, there’s simply no winning in talking about it. The worst part though is the slight hope of redemption, because this is only a prequel to the mobile
        game, so you could say that the real story is just beginning. As is seen in some other communities around, prequels can, and will, be ignored in favor of better mainline story. So all I
        can really say at the end of this is please, for all that is good and holy, if there’s ever to be a continuation of the anime prequel, let it be like the first 3 episodes rather than the
        rest. Let it be something that will allow this unique concept to properly soar and take flight, let it be something that allows everyone to forget about this atrocity of a dumpster fire
        that was this precursor. So once more I reiterate, if you have the willpower to watch the first three episodes and leave the rest in limbo, I can’t recommend these earlier pieces enough.
        If you don’t think you have the restraint however, unless you’re a sucker for pain, there’s no reason for you to be watching this series. All it will bring is ruin and disappointment to
        anyone who watches it.
