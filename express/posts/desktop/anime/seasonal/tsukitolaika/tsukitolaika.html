        <h2 class="brightText" style = "padding-top: 4%">Is It Worth Watching?</h2>
        <p class="mediumText">
          First off, If you’re even thinking about watching “Tsuki To Laika” you probably know a good bit about it already, and have actively searched out information regarding it. There’s space,
          vampires, and a touch of romance all amid this air of peculiarity that manages to find itself a coherent story, making use of those unique aspects. The space theme might misrepresent
          itself however, as there’s not a lot of technical stuff mentioned within it. This isn’t necessarily a knock against the show by any means, but rather a fair warning to anyone that may
          have assumed that it played a larger technical role than it lets on in its first season. With that disclaimer out of the way, the best way that I can think of to explain Tsuki To Laika,
          is that it’s a Slice of Life series with a slow burn, and more mature/classic romance themes to it. It’s an outlier in plenty of ways, but most; if not all of them, are well done and
          bring an interesting and refreshing angle to its experience. It brings natural character progression with down-to-earth personalities, interactions, and drama; pairing it with a really
          interesting, fictitious version of the first spaceflight in human history. The vampire aspect hardly takes you out of the story, as the subject is used to insert themes of racism and
          xenophobia (which includes some surprisingly cool visuals) rather than it be some fantastical aspect to the plot. There’s a lot of weird stuff going on within Tsuki To Laika for sure,
          but if you enjoy weird, and want something that really feels different - as well as unique- amid the sea of stereotypical romance stories, this show is for you. It’s able to be
          incredibly refreshing and relaxing, while keeping your attention consistently without hinging on leaving you hanging on every possible cliche interruption between the two characters.
        </p>

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Kaleidoscope Vision</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          One of the things that you quickly realize Tsuki To Laika excels at is the amount of perspectives it can convey without it becoming too confusing, or overwhelming. There isn’t exactly a
          personality archetype given for each character as they all flow quite well; influencing and playing off of each other in what feels like a very natural manner. There’s the thorny rose
          of a character, willing to jump on anyone given the chance, but they learn to grow, and accept that their personality is in defence of their weaker aspects as well as the challenging
          nature of the time period. There’s the golden boy, who does everything right, but then loses touch of his grace, realizing his foolishness in the face of true heart. The big wigs of the
          spaceflight team, who aren’t cold and distant, but all harbor some love and camaraderie for everyone involved, being able to show emotion and develop relationships with the characters.
          There’s a whole host of people full of life in this story, and it makes the interactions and changes feel that much more satisfying, as more and more people begin to meet eye to eye,
          making their differences slowly iron themselves out. This part is largely thanks to Lev, the male lead character, as he does a wonderful job of influencing those around him, which
          coincidentally plays a rather strong role further down the road in the series. Where the real difference in perspective happens however, is in regards to the vampire girl who’s serving
          as a test subject to the USZR’s space program; Irina Luminesk. Her existence as a vampire in the Cosmonaut program is a very hot topic, with all manner of reactions to her existence.
          It’s not just, “Ahh the vampire is bad and scary!” or, “She’s just like us guys!”. There’s a bevy of different responses and varying intensities of dispositions towards the ambitious
          girl, who’s turned a cold shoulder towards humanity. Not only that, but there are all sorts of conclusions and developments of said dispositions towards Irina. The racists and
          xenophobes don’t just get discarded, nor do they all get redemption arcs either. Some are fired, removed to far off facilities. Some are publicly criticized without any action taken
          against them. Some continue to be allowed to act the way they do, and some make the turnaround to positivity and equality. It feels like a very human approach and can make for some
          tougher to watch moments, but it doesn’t rely on trauma for you to understand the racism and xenophobia that she can face, or how everyone in her corner, including herself, deals
          with it. It feels eerily natural and realistic for the situation, and adds a great angle to the story to offset the more rose colored scenes that mellow it out.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        I’m not sure where the fad of vampires conveying love or romantic feelings via biting one another came from, but I’m all for it really. Tsuki To Laika takes it a step further though, and
        uses some interesting visual tricks with Irina. In the early episodes as Lev gets to know Irina *as* Irina and not just the vampire he’s meant to train, there’s a series of closeups on
        her that can come off relatively erotic, but are actually a little different. Yes, Lev’s a young man and Irina’s very attractive, but it’s more so a fascination with her anatomy. She bares
        large fangs, a sharp tongue, and sports a set of somewhat pointed ears. These details catch Lev’s eye, as he takes in all her characteristics and finds himself lost in them. They quickly
        stop appearing though as Lev sees Irina more and more as herself, and the two kindle what first manifests as camaraderie, before quickly turning into budding romance. What I really like
        with their romance is that it flows and isn’t unjustly interrupted to drag it out. The two share their “first kiss” (really Irina sucking Lev’s blood), roughly halfway through the season,
        and Irina comfortably warms up to Lev to the point that she willingly relies on him, a human. It’s a natural bond that grows freely and doesn’t ever feel forced, like each revelation or
        dramatic issue is from nowhere. It’s an electric pairing that the story doesn’t try to waste time on, but rather attempts to start developing as soon as it can. The end goal isn’t for the
        pair to *get together*, but rather to *be together*. A simple one word difference, but the changes it makes in their story are quite large, and in my opinion, the direction that romance
        stories should be heading towards (think RomComs like Horimiya, for example). It’s a great shift to a more mature format that older demographics can enjoy, and can paint a better picture
        than the more “childish” renditions that are currently popular. Lev and Irina have their disagreements, and each harbors jealousy in regards to the other, but it never becomes a long
        running issue. Irina sees Lev with a female comrade late at night, and she gets jealous because it wasn’t her. The jealousy fades away just as quickly as it appeared though. She gets
        stressed, and towards the end of the season falls into despair due to a handful of certain events. As a quick side note, it’s a really wonderful and meaningful moment in terms of their
        romance. It speaks volumes about Irina’s (rightfully developed) persecution complex, and how even things done with a good heart and good intentions can come off wrong. Anyway, getting
        back to where I trailed off to. Despite the despair and sadness she feels in the moment Anya, her friend-slash-assigned-scientist, is able to calm her down, and helps her understand that
        it’s not a fit of rage that resets their relationship, but more so Irina falling off of a cliff, only to be grabbed before she starts to plummet.

        In one way or another I’ve mentioned how “low key” most of Tsuki To Laika is, but it’s really an important draw to its story I think. Each moment carries tension, but none of them are unduly so.
        There’s cutoffs in Lev’s and Irina’s romantic development, but it’s not to the point that they make no headroom with one another, or that it completely ruins the moments; they flow smoothly
        even in those conversations cut short, which is something that’s not usually seen in anime. The racism and xenophobia of Irina isn’t blown out of proportion or caricaturized, but handled with
        nuance, and respect, so that it can be taken seriously. One of the greatest examples of this is Irina’s mental state. On the outside she seems tough as nails, but opens up to the viewer very
        quickly; a bold decision, but I think it makes the development of Irina and Lev that much better. You have an inside look to her mindset before Lev does, so you can understand the complexities
        of her hesitations, and subsequent reaching out to Lev in dire times. She starts out wanting that isolation because of how she thinks humans should be, and Lev breaks down those barriers little
        by little. Eventually, she begins to rely on him to make it through her testing in preparation for the spaceflight, and develops one of her first meaningful relationships with a human. The best,
        and really the most important part here, is to remember that Lev doesn’t know the intricacies of Irina’s past as well as the viewer does. We get to *see* her dreams and her memories, Lev gets to
        hear details of them here and there. This type of storytelling really helps us form an emotional attachment to Irina without making it seem overly dramatic. They have endless creative freedom
        (resulting in some expertly executed moments) in pulling Irina’s deepest fears and darkest nights from her mind and presenting them to us visually, but they expertly limit how Irina is able to
        explain them to Lev. I really want to try and get across how great these dramatic developments are without being incredibly high stakes or ridiculously over the top and unrealistic, but I also
        *really* don’t want to spoil any of the story, as I’d say these developments are key to the enjoyment of it. Regardless, hopefully I’ve made a good enough case as to why Tsuki To Laika can keep
        your attention without making you roll your eyes at every other scene you might watch in a different series, as it attempts to drag itself out for a longer runtime.

        Tsuki To Laika is really a bit of an oddball in anime, it doesn’t lean entirely into its more experimental side, nor does it revoke its more standard aspects. The easiest way to explain this would be
        to tell you to watch the opening for the show. The music, by “ALI PROJECT”, is pretty experimental, but it’s not completely inaccessible to a “normal” viewer or listener. The same can be said about
        some of the visual decisions made in the series. The high fidelity close ups of Irina early on, the disturbing piecemealed flashbacks and nightmares which she has, the depiction of how she handles
        sunlight, and so on and so forth. Even the music choices are really solid, there’s a lot of standard OST to it, but it also takes a lot of inspiration of the era in a healthy helping of Jazz and other
        similar music genres. All of these aspects are standouts in the series that might not be overly appealing to every last prospective viewer, but they certainly add quite a bit to the show in its own
        unique visual and auditory ways. Sometimes there’s small creative choices, like a difference in how reflections on ice would actually be, or overexeggerating how the night sky might look, or Irina’s
        various reactions to things in the more romantic and relaxed moments, but there’s also times that it goes above and beyond. I had mentioned the vampire bite scene earlier, and it’s really a great
        example of it, or when Irina goes out to skate on the lake one night, or a certain moment in the last episode of the show. There’s a great balance of smaller creative tweaks and massive visual changes
        to offset it. It’s not really a stylistic choice per se, but more so something meant to make it stand out in an appealing way. Could it be seen as experimental? Yeah, it could, but I don’t think it
        is. To me, it feels more like an extension of the emotions and thoughts of the characters. The night sky can look like a night sky for the most part, but when Lev and Irina look up at it, the sky
        can seem like it’s alive, as it turns into a fantastical depiction to parallel their wonderment in regards to space. It’s a hard concept to explain without seeing it first, but it’s a really unique
        aspect that adds to the warm peculiarity that helps separate itself from everything else out there.

        On paper; unless you’re already interested in the show, it can be a really hard sell because it seems like it’s all over the place, and you’d be right if you just looked at the stats. Putting it all
        together into something that works well, and can captivate its viewers, is part of its magic. It’s something impossible to explain properly, but it just seems to work. A vampire girl that wants to go
        to the moon before humanity can dirty it, and a young Cosmonaut that’s lost his chance being forced to train her. A concept that certainly grabs your attention, but doesn’t really convince you right
        away. Simply put, do yourself the favor and give it the chance to convince you, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. I definitely won’t say that it’s for everyone, but I think there’s at least one thing
        that everyone will like about it. It’s not perfect, but it does things right in its own way. It’s not a standout critical success, but a warm and casual experience that makes watching easy and enjoyable.
        Tsuki To Laika creates a highly unique experience for being in such a familiar package, while still teasing it has much more to offer. Not a 10/10 by any means, though it is definitely a name that will
        linger on many tongues after they finish watching it. And if you *do* finish watching it, and want more, there’s most certainly a chance for it to get another season as it ends with a story that can be
        continued, or can be comfortably left as is. In case you don’t want to wait for the news of a potential second season though, the Light Novel is currently in the process of production and distribution
        internationally (no ETA on release as of writing this article however)!
