        So, it’s been a bit since the release of the Thousand Year Blood War trailer, and I’ve been listening to and watching it quite often this last while. There’s a lot to think about in regards to a comeback 10 years
        in the making, especially when it’s the “final” conclusion to the story of many a childhood. Before really getting into it though there’s a few things to brush out of the way. Is it a massive hype reel? Yes, of
        course. Is it just taking the coolest panels of the manga without spoiling much of the story? Also yes. Does that detract from the trailer any? Absolutely not. To me, the style of Bleach and its characters has
        always been a massive selling point, and this Thousand Year Blood War trailer is no different.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          Let’s start there then, the style. The rose colored glasses weren’t exactly there on my first watch of the trailer to be honest. I was critical of the art style, despite its fidelity, thinking that it might have
          deviated too far from where the anime had left off. Watching more and more of it though (and being reminded of the amazing leaps and bounds of Kubo’s art in the manga) I started to warm up to it. Bleach has hardly
           ever been static, the styles and outfits of characters outside of their Shinigami ones change frequently and there’s been an incredible amount of promotional material, openings and endings, and story subplots that
           showcase the characters in all sorts of different outfits and styles. So while it took me a little bit, I’ve definitely warmed up to the visual changes made for TYBW, especially the Getsuga Tenshou. It really
           feels like the next step for Bleach in style and animation. Speaking of “the next step”, the modernisation of ‘Number One’ was something else, it took me a second to even recognize it as Ichigo’s theme. Such a
           great adaptation to modern music while keeping the classic feel and adding an absolutely intangible energy to the trailer, this one song has me endlessly excited for what the Thousand Year Blood War anime will
           bring in its original soundtrack.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        From a more technical standpoint of the trailer though, my god, the work in this is incredible. The transitions and text are modern and punchy, the lighting is out of this world on all the characters, it’s smooth, it’s
        stylistic, it’s high quality, it’s everything you could want. If I had to pick a favorite part from the trailer it would easily be Ichigo unleashing his Getsuga Tenshou at the end. The shadows on him are awesome, his
        Bankai outfit change is great and I love that they added much more shape and size to him in the trailer compared to the older anime, and the visuals for his Getsuga Tenshou itself are out of this world. It’s a pretty big
        leap from how it was previously depicted in the anime, and though it’s hard to explain it feels like this new style has gone in the opposite direction of the previous. It’s an amazing stylistic change that’s pulled off
        really well. *On top of all that*, the distorted frames as he swings Tensa Zangetsu are just so well done. It’s easily the peak of the trailer for me (and many others), but I’d think that adult Hitsugaya is a very close
        second in terms of popularity for most.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        On the other side of the coin however, a trailer of this quality has me doubtful of if it’s even possible to anime at this sort of quality. Studio Pierrot really only has one other work in recent memory that can match this,
        that being Akudama Drive. It’s not an overly popular show in anime circles but it’s an absolute must watch in my opinion and easily one of the top anime of 2020. You’d think I wouldn’t have any concern given my high praise
        for Akudama Drive, I mean, it had a great soundtrack and some crazy animation and lighting and everything. The concern comes from it being a measly 12 episodes where the manga was developed in parallel to it. It wasn’t an
        adaptation of over 200 chapters, or roughly 30% of a manga chronicling nearly 700 chapters. Akudama Drive also didn’t have any previous issues of heavy amounts of anime filler and original content or other issues of the sort.
        This isn’t to be a doomsayer of the TYBW adaptation, but just saying that I’m doing my best to temper my expectations given what the trailer has given us. In an era of modern disappointment and critical overworking of an
        industry, there’s a limit to how good things can be within a certain window. Studio Pierrot certainly isn’t a MAPPA by any means, but they just recently took a break on Black Clover and are still working full steam ahead
        on Boruto.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        I know it sounds like I’m going back and forth on everything and being indecisive on my verdict of the trailer, but really I think that’s the best standpoint here. It’s simply too hard to know how it’s going to turn out. Akudama
        Drive was made during Pierrot’s run of both Boruto and Black Clover, and it turned out insane. Bleach’s Thousand Year Blood War had itself first announced on its 20th anniversary in early 2020, and we still won’t be getting it
        until October of next year, an over 2 year difference since the original announcement which doesn’t even count any rumors or anything either. There’s a really good chance that they can make a repeat of Akudama Drive quality
        with Bleach, but there’s also a lot that it depends on.
      </p>

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        I’ve made plenty of comparisons to Akudama Drive now, so why don’t I make some to old Bleach? I’ve said it feels like the next step within itself but I think the part that most intrigues me is the elicitation of nostalgia from it.
        It has the undisputed air of “Classic Bleach” to it, and I would be lying if I said that wasn’t a draw to this adaptation of the final arc, but that’s not all. It’s not *just* nostalgia, there’s decisively original and evolved style and
        feeling to it, it’s not a re-skinned Bleach, it’s a *new* Bleach. The best example of this would be the new ‘Number One’ used in the trailer. Is it Ichigo’s theme? That’s a resounding yes, but it isn’t Ichigo’s Theme from 10 years ago.
        Some people may be upset that it isn’t, but I think it’s one of a few important deviations to really let itself stand on its own. On paper it doesn’t seem like a huge difference, and it’s a pretty big assumption to make from just one
        trailer, but you can take one look and see that it’s not meant to bring back memories of the old. It’s Bleach through and through, and it has a past tied to it, but it doesn’t hesitate in looking back and instead focuses on its own future
        and what’s to come, placing it squarely in its own territory where it can stand free of the chains of nostalgia while still being Bleach.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">What It Comes Down To</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Really, I think Studio Pierrot is in a position to leave a massive mark on modern anime with Bleach’s Thousand Year Blood War, in either a really good or a really bad way. They have the perfect storm of freed up resources, passion and
        interest in the series and a precursor that shows they can have outstanding execution. Bleach has the popularity to take the anime industry by its horns and show people how it should *really* be done. I can’t claim to have any insight
        on TYBW’s production or timeline, but having over a two year gap between initial announcement and release, and even nearly a year’s worth between its first trailer and release is what I’d call a relatively good sign. If their production
        is even somewhat close to the scenario pieced together from this information there’s potential for a landslide of change in anime. I mean, there’s moments that feel like it’s straight out of a movie in the trailer, the quality and care
        put into it is something else. KyoAni has been a beacon of change in the animation industry for a while but they haven’t gotten their hands on anything *groundbreaking* to make, Pierrot has this one chance to do so with Bleach.
