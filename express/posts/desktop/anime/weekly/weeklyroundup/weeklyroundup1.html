          It’s a bit challenging to write out all your thoughts on each episode you watch a week in semi-understandable fashion, but I really enjoy talking about everything that I end
          up watching. The solution to this? Well, you’re reading it. Rather than try to write out everything about each show I watch, I’m taking the advice of someone who’s name I’ve
          sadly forgotten (terribly sorry!) and doing a rough roundup of everything I’ve watched in a week. Doing it this way lets me excitedly chat about my favorite series of each
          season, but also lets me drop some names for other shows that are fun or interesting but don’t illicit that desire to write about them each week. So here we’ve ended up, the
          first Weekly Anime Roundup! As a side note and a bit of a preemptive TLDR, this week starts on Wednesday because there’s no shows out yet on Monday or Tuesday that I’m
          interested in (nothing on Friday yet either), and the show list is as follows:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          Wednesday - In The Land of Leadale, Orient, Police In A Pod; Thursday - Tokyo 24th Ward, Ousama Ranking, Platinum End; Saturday - My Dress Up Darling, Akebi’s Sailor Uniform;
          Sunday - Requiem Of The Rose King, Sasaki And Miyano.
        </p>
    </div>

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Wednesday</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          Wednesday had a decent few shows that I was interested to find out about, and as the first proper new batch of series I had some decently high expectations for it. I wouldn’t
          say those expectations were betrayed, but more so I had a different understanding of what stuff might have been. In The Land Of Leadale just avoided what I was hoping for it
          to talk about, it’s main character finds themself in their video game world after the power goes out at the hospital they’re a terminal patient at. It does talk about it a
          little bit, but mostly in a joking manner rather than something sincere and impactful, so it just wasn’t for me. I did enjoy the art style though as it felt a bit older than
          the typical modern versions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          The next show on the docket is Orient, from the creator of Magi. It was pretty cool, pretty different but at times similar to Magi though not the same quality or style. It’s a
          fun first episode that’s relatively plain and very clearly meant for younger audiences, and there’s some odd stuff to it, but none of it’s really enough to turn you away from
          watching if you’ve got a free 20 minutes and nothing better to do. The last Monday show, and the one that I needed to be forced to watch *despite* saying I was going to watch
          it (thanks RJ) was Police In A Pod. I vowed to never make an Uramichi Oniisan blunder again so I was committed to watching it, but it slipped through my fingers day after day
          until I watched it yesterday. I was so glad I finally got to watch it, some really great adult humor that’s pretty sitcom in style but has some solid execution. It’s dry and a
          bit witty and rather stupid, and it centers around mundane day to day tasks in its first episode and has some great fun with the concept. If you like comedy in any shape or
          form, or like something like Brooklyn 99 odds are you’ll have a good time watching it, just hope that people can give it a chance if they’re not recommend it!

        There was only one new show airing on Wednesday that I was interested in, Tokyo 24th Ward, but thankfully it was a double episode. This show has a lot going on from the get go so
        having that double length really helped get viewers interested in it and gave a better picture of what it’s about. It starts with a flashback and exposition for how they reach the
        end of the first episode, which makes sense given the possible miscommunication in what the show might be versus what it is. There’s a lot going for it but it is a bit messy with
        its first episode, so hopefully the story manages to smooth itself out over time. Overall though, after seeing the three shows that Cloverworks has been working on for this season
        (Tokyo 24th Ward being one of them) I’m both impressed and concerned at the visual beauty and fluidity of each of them.  Whether they’re able to keep that quality up and take care
        of their animators is a different story though sadly. Regardless of that though, I’m certainly interested in where Tokyo 24th Ward ends up going as it has a whole host of different
        themes in it about the progression of society, over-policing/preventative justice, and poverty.
      </p>

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Aside from that we started the second cours of Ousama Ranking and Platinum End, both of which I was excited about. Ousama Ranking starts us fresh with a new arc and characters, and
        gives us some interesting mysteries to unravel. It’s basically like a soft reset from a main story perspective but we’re picking up in a different spot, so it was pretty fun to watch.
        The real takeaway from it though was the overwhelmingly incredible new opening that it featured. If you haven’t watched it you really should, easily stands atop 2022 confidently and
        I’ve a hard time believing anything else will crop up that can beat it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Where Ousama Ranking gives us a bit of a fresh start, Platinum End picks up exactly where it left off and lets Kanade give one of my favorite villain speeches of recent memory.
        Meaningful and modern, it’s a hypocritical dialogue about the rich and powerful and their worldviews, and manages to tie itself into the religious tones of the show perfectly.
        If you like a good villain speech or a critique about the lives of the ultra wealthy and powerful, I definitely recommend watching episode 13 of Platinum End.

        There wasn’t anything that really got me curious this Friday, so we’re fast-forwarding to Saturday which features the two Juggernauts of the Slice of Life genre for this season!
        While both are massive, I certainly have my preference and it’s not very close. This may be a hot take, but My Dress Up Darling can’t even touch Akebi’s Sailor Uniform if it
        wanted to try. There, I said it. Akebi is far better than Marin. She’s way cuter and just awakenings your parental instinct to coddle and spoil and treat like an angel, because
        she *is*. Marin’s great and all, but unless you’re a high school student the appeal isn’t there in the same way that it is for Akebi. Both are still pretty solid though, bar a
        few oddities that pulled me out of My Dress Up Darling. Marin has so much detail and care placed into her character, yet Gojou is as plain as day, not only in his looks. Sure,
        make him look plain but at least make the pair look like they received the same amount of attention. Overall though, their first episode was pretty fun other than the typical
        Rom-Com stuff like fan-service and a way-more-dangerous-than-depicted fall that allows the two to meet. Textiles work and Cosplay as the focus of a series is an interesting
        niche to pursue so I’m curious to see what they come up with.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        On the flip side though, Akebi could do almost anything and I’d be hooked on it. Just so much cuteness and grace in everything she does, and a nice handful of funny moments and
        sincerity in her journey into her new school. Really just a slice of life show that’s done so well that you could watch them do anything, and the first episode checks some
        pretty interesting boxes in that regard. Either way, I can easily recommend either of these two shows, but my personal favorite is Akebi. Just so heartwarming.

        Alright before anyone wonders about it, no I’m not an AOT fan. Hardly have great interest in it, but will partake in discussions about Isayama because regardless of stance on
        something, creators deserve respect for their honest work no matter your personal feelings. *Ahem*, with that out of the way, the first show I watched Sunday was Requiem Of The
        Rose King, an interesting series inspired by Shakespeare. I’m a sucker for those types of crossovers or creative concepts so I knew I had to check it out and was not at all
        disappointed. The only failing aspect was the character designs as they pale in comparison to the wonderful backgrounds done. All’s not bad though as there’s certain moments
        that are pretty creative that make good use of the visuals of the characters in an enjoyable way, so I’m willing to let it slide. The story itself is solid and interesting, and
        very much matches that drama feeling you’d get from a Shakespeare play. Seeing it in an animated medium as well is really interesting because it allows for far more creative
        freedom than when executed as a play. Really curious to see what they end up doing with what they have here, some really interesting stuff that might fly under the radar
        because of potential BL.

        Sasaki and Miyano was the other item on the list for today, though I tried Futsal Boys because of how much I enjoyed Re-Main but it wasn’t too similar a styling for a sports
        anime so wasn’t for me, and it was actually really solid! BL anime tends to have a bit of a bad rep for quality and the like, but Sasaki and Miyano checks all the boxes for
        quality but doesn’t quite forgo its roots. There’s still a decent number of tropes in it, but they play an interesting and useful role and keep the story flowing decently well.
        It’s a fun little romance series that seems very enjoyable from its first episode and doesn’t try to do anything crazy. It’s BL through and through and it has the tropes you’d
        expect, but it doesn’t make it weird or overly dramatic, but instead puts a normal and more comedic spin on them that gives you a good laugh instead of an eye roll. Really,
        regardless of personal taste I’d recommend Sasaki and Miyano because it’s just plain fun, some good romance roots but a healthy helping of jokes and the like.

        I’ve heard a lot of people say that this season isn’t as crazy as previous ones, and in a way that’s true, but I think because of that I’ve been able to give more shows a fair
        chance in this first week and consequently have picked up a decent few series that I might not have otherwise. Sasaki and Miyano, for example, would be one of those shows. If
        there were more blockbuster series the probability that I’d have given it a chance would be way slimmer, so in a way I’m glad it’s a slower season. That doesn’t mean it’s devoid
        of great anime, I’d say it’s largely the opposite as a lot of these series seem really good, just that none of them are super big names or were hugely popular beforehand. So
        maybe a bit to remember from this first week is to give stuff a chance, you never really know what you’ll end up finding. You’ll miss out on stuff like Police In A Pod or maybe
        miss your chance to get a better idea of BL from something like Sasaki and Miyano. There’s always a lot of anime each season so no fault to anyone that doesn’t have the time
        and energy to sift through the masses, but maybe that’s what this piece of writing will help you with!
