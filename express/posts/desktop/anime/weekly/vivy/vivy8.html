          Episode 8 starts us off with a backstory of Ophelia and her support AI, Antonio. We see Ophelia struggling in the smaller stages as Antonio tries his best to support her. The two have very different
          personalities but they work well together, Ophelia looking up to and respecting Antonio, and Antonio protecting and nurturing Ophelia. Their clearly had a close relationship and even potentially a
          bond, making the cause for her suicide seem to make sense. She lost the only person that praised her singing and was forced to carry on without him, only to rise to such meteoric heights where she
          can't share the limelight and excitement with anyone. With the reasoning for the suicide out of the way Diva and Matsumoto move in closer in an attempt to get closer with Ophelia to stop her from
          killing herself. Thanks to Diva's development she's upset with Matsumoto's decision on attempting to simply stopping her from committing suicide after her performance. Instead she opts to try and
          tackle the problem at its root. This leads Diva into what is essentially a memorial hall of the achievements of the various AI. The hall leads us to the resting place of Antonio's body, where the
          two have a bit of a deeper conversation regarding the meaning of their relationship and her desires and everything. It gets a little sad so Diva attempts to perk the conversation up and set Ophelia
          on the right path for her performance that will be happening soon.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p>
          Before we can go further with the story of Ophelia we're rudely interrupted by an anomaly, Kakitani of Toak. Matsumoto opts to not do anything with the information right away as ensuring Ophelia lives
          is the most important task. As such Matsumoto and Diva idly chat while watching Ophelia's performance. Diva asks about Vivy and Matsumoto gives half-truths about her existence as the show unfolds in
          front of them. The playful conversation ends as Ophelia finishes her performance with Diva proclaiming she's going to see Ophelia to make sure the suicide doesn't become a problem. Once more Kakitani
          appears before Diva as she makes her way to Ophelia's dressing room. Rather than move to meet Ophelia she gets distracted and follows Kakitani. The revelation confuses Matsumoto as he doesn't see anyone
          on the cameras where Diva claims them to be. It's only once Diva gives chase to him that Matsumoto realizes he wasn't the only one to hack into the cameras. After being lured away, Diva's confronted by
          Kakitani, shooting her with a logical bullet and rendering her unconscious. In the meanwhile, Matsumoto is panicking about not realizing what had happened and immediately rushes to the rooftop from where
          Ophelia jumps from in the official history. With Diva incapacitated Matsumoto is the one to make contact with Ophelia on the rooftop where the two share an awkward conversation before Ophelia reveals
          her true colors. The AI known as the Fairy of The Small Theater is not Ophelia, but Antonio. That is to say, Antonio has taken over Ophelia's body.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        While the episode is still very solid overall this ending really irked me in the wrong way. The story itself isn't a problem, it's an action based anime that takes on a lot of other aspects, not the other
        way around. The issue I find is in bringing all these meanings and conversations to the table about Suicide and despair and hopelessness and then ripping away their significance. It's teasing the tackling
        of mental health and suicide and to that degree it sort of bothers me. The conversations they had leading up to the reveal are not worth less in their meaning in reality, but the concept is not something
        I'm comfortable with or interested in. My biggest issue is the deviation on how the rest of Vivy has handled these sorts of things. The rest of all these mental health occurrences have been very honest and
        candid and haven't been purely a plot device as with Ophelia/Antonio. There's meaning behind their happenings, and they're true to life issues and experiences that can be related to and understood, and
        that's where part of Vivy's charm comes from. It tackles these real life experiences with a hero. Anyone struggling with similar experiences and feelings can find that an existence not unlike their own is
        being shown as the hero. An existence that feels despair, that has no hope, an existence that has to live through PTSD, countless deaths, and so much more. It's a chance for people who experience and feel
        similarly to have themselves represented in the spotlight not "just" as something that's there for dramatic effect, but as the hero of their story. That's where I draw discontent from this revelation. They've
        treated this piece of mental health differently as the rest of the story, everything else is sincere and candid but this time it's purely a plot device. It's Antonio self-destructing and dragging other AI
        with him, it's not the distressed songstress who worked so hard to reach the spotlight to only be left with a whole in her life caused by her missing partner.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Another one of my large gripes with this episode is the experiences and disposition of Diva. To clarify, all interactions of Diva's that don't center around the discussion of heart, and to that degree
        humanity, explicitly are perfectly fine and well executed in the episode but I differ from the episode in my understanding of Diva on these conversations. My issue is with Diva having found the answer
        to what it means to put your heart into something. Diva isn't the one that would have come up with the answer herself. The main point in this being that in the official history Diva never makes the main
        stage or gets near the following that she has in this version of history. The difference between these two is Vivy and her experiences. From my perspective Vivy is the only thing that could bring Diva
        closer to the understanding she oh so wants, but here we are decades down the road with Diva knowing the answer and Vivy locked away. To put it simply it confuses me. The show thus far has been pushing
        the angle that Vivy is the humanity that exists in Diva and that she's the one that will save the world and learn along the way. Vivy's experiences and memories and mannerisms are what allow Diva to
        thrive, but here we have a Diva without a Vivy and Diva's doing just fine. It seems so contradictory considering all the information that we have as viewers but it's happened nonetheless. It doesn't
        necessarily ruin the episode for me, but with this revelation coupled with Antonio's reveal places this as the lowest episode on my list of Vivy episodes. It's not to say that the content in between
        these two points is all around awful, it's quality is still there, but the story and meanings of this episode are thrown to the wayside in the name of progression and action. I can't blame them for
        forcing the action and story to progress but for me it ruins this piece of Vivy's history, Diva finding the answer while Vivy is locked away skews any relationship the two have in the future for me, and
        Ophelia's suicide completely loses steam as we find out that it's not Ophelia. My only hope is that for the remaining episode(s) of this arc and the rest of the story these moments do not play a critical
        role in the story as a whole and are able to be forgotten amongst the rest of the (hopefully) outstanding episodes we have left.
