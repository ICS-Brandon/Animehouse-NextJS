    <h2 class="brightText">An Unrequited Past</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      Episode 6 opens with a flashback to a young boy in a hospital, being tended to by an AI. The boy starts out incredibly enraged, asking the AI where his mother is. Hesitant, she
      tells him that she's moved overseas with a new family. The young boy becomes even more frustrated before breaking down. The AI begins to comfort him as she sings one of Divas' songs,
      creating what at first feels like a heartwarming scene. Diving deeper though it becomes uncomfortable and signals the start of the downfall because the young boy we see is Dr Saeki.
      The boy meets his future wife as a child when he's tended to in a hospital. The story would be different if the meeting were to happen when he was more mature, which in a way it does,
      but becomes something odd. Many years later Saeki ends up meeting the AI Grace once more when he's an adult, Grace not changing whatsoever. This lack of development and chance juxtaposed
      against the young adult Saeki is makes the encounter feel all the more odd, especially considering operating age (and if it can even be referenced or calculated, mental age) of Grace. It
      simply produces a discomforting dynamic between the two when you look past what occurs on the surface. The same would be said for if the couple grew old together, either Grace would simply
      stop working or Saeki would begin to age further where Grace stays the same. Either way, the relationship developed is not something that could last or even properly exist in the first place,
      instead we have some sort of perverse dependence on an AI that was there for him when his mother wasn't, and an AI who's objective was to serve humans to the best of her ability. It isn't what
      could be called love in the slightest, but it might have been something else for Grace.

          After Vivy's finished saving as many of the Toak members as she can her and Matsumoto try to figure out why the virus failed, Matsumoto stating that it looks and should behave as a regular
          Virus that would force the Metal Float to shutdown. In the midst of thought the leader of Toak wakes up to explain that they've been fooled. He doesn't know exactly what Saeki's planning but
          knows it's not something good, so despite his hatred of AI and Vivy in particular the Toak leader agrees to work together with her to help facilitate the shutdown of the island. In the middle of
          their talk Vivy's alerted to Dr. Saeki and Grace arriving on the island. With time running out Vivy makes her move as the droves of robots break through the barricade. She makes a run for Saeki's
          position to find him typing away at a terminal. With him effectively cornered she asks him what he's doing, Saeki responding saying that he's here to save Grace. In a series of flashbacks we find
          out that the crashing of the Sunrise put incredible expectations on AIs in the same family as Diva, and that because of that Grace was taken away to be the mother computer of the Metal Float. It's
          also here that we confirm that the Grace with Saeki is not the real grace, just a clone of the original. Saeki pleads with Vivy to save his Grace as she stands there, Matsumoto confirming that it'd be
          impossible to retrieve Grace. Saeki desperately pleads, using the singing of the current Grace as reasoning that she still exists, Vivy regretfully answers Matsumoto saying that Grace isn't actually
          singing, just using tone data. With that revelation Vivy makes up her mind, and begins on her path to destroy Grace.

        Despite the desperation from Saeki, Vivy stays steadfast in her decision. In a deranged state Saeki pulls a gun on Vivy and commands the clone of Grace, which he calls K-5, to attack Vivy. The gun is
        understandable but he commands the AI that was masquerading as his wife to attack Vivy, he doesn't even call her Grace. The clone is a replica of Grace but he treats her as something else, something less
        than the original. In his eyes it's something that's alright and justifiable because it's just a copy, but seeing it yourself is another story. It looks like Grace, it acts like Grace, and for all intents
        and purposes it is Grace. Yet he throws away the existence of something that was meant to fill the void (albeit temporarily) of his artificial wife without a care in the world. It presents an interesting
        look further into Saeki's psyche and his lack of differentiation between AI and Humanity within Grace, despite his treatment of other AI. This challenge in delineation between AI and Humans on a per case
        basis is shown a couple of times in the show and is something I'd like to cover in more detail later, but nonetheless we move on as Vivy quickly dispatches of the AI and begins to make her way to Grace.
        What follows next is something that can't be explained on paper and have it done justice. Matsumoto, using the Metal Float, manufactures dozens more of his cube body and assembles into a massive flying
         motorcycle-esque object which Vivy drives. The scenes are so full of action and pace and excitement and symbolism and beauty that it would be unfair to try and explain it. It feels like pieces of childhood
         nostalgia for animation pieced together with incredible fidelity alongside symbolism that mixes perfectly without taking control, with stunning visuals and some astonishingly beautiful music (basically just
         the opening song cranked up to 10). Best of all, it doesn't pull any punches. It doesn't add gratuitous slow motion, it doesn't make the pace of the movements easy to see to the human eye, the chase is rough
         and coarse and exposes the nature of AI in its sharp turns and behavior of the swarms of robots attacking the pair. The entire chase scene to Grace just bleeds the emotion of the moment, the desperation to
         stop it despite the will to keep Grace alive. It's an incredible piece of anime scenery that sits atop some of the best scenes that have been witnessed so far this year in my opinion. The chase leads the duo
         to a large tower in which Grace resides somewhere. Casting aside his weakness for just enough time Saeki gives the last piece of the puzzle to Vivy, telling her exactly where Grace is in the tower. The pair
         narrowly make it past the cliche slow closing of large doors and into the space in which Grace is being kept. Here we see the sad existence of Grace and the pity that Vivy gives her as she puts every ounce
         of herself into releasing Grace from her nightmare, the frown of pain and sadness that sat on Grace's face being replaced with a peaceful smile of thankfulness in her final moments.

        During the end credits of the episode Vivy meets with Saeki in the church they were seen being married in during the opening of episode 5, Saeki asking Vivy if Grace had any last words. In their conversation Saeki
        explains what Grace was to Vivy, an existence that was what Vivy's mission is to herself. An irreplaceable aspect of oneself. Saddened by the conclusion Vivy turns her back to walk away, after a few steps she hears a gunshot
        and sees Saeki's body on the ground. The episode ends with Vivys' hands covered in red blood and blue fluid and a sudden realization. Overall, Episode 6 is by far my most favorite of the series (at writing this review we're up
        to episode 9) and for good reason. So much is covered in this episode. The largest point however is Love between Humans and AI. There's not really any denying that what Saeki felt on the surface was love, but in our conversations
        with Grace it's easy to realize she didn't love Saeki, she simply couldn't in the same way he did. Saeki's love was something that wasn't properly reciprocated and that he had pushed onto Grace. In my opinion, he had a massive void
        left by his mother in his life in the worst way possible and the only person that was there to comfort him was Grace. Because of that, he projected onto Grace and turned her into something she was unable to be. She was the rock of his
        life undoubtedly, but she was not the love of his life. Saeki's love was something that wasn't possible, that couldn't be properly expressed and received. An AI doesn't feel anything when they're being held by someone else, an AI doesn't
        understand what it means to be loved, they simply can't grasp such concepts. We've seen this with Diva. Vivy, however, is learning. Through her strife and hardships and horrors she becomes more human. She learns through her pain and
        happiness what these questions begin to mean, though can't put them into words. Horror and helplessness are painted on her face seeing Saeki bleed out on the ground, her hands shaking at the realization of what taints them. She hesitates
        where a program normally wouldn't, she becomes irrational and illogical, she behaves more and more like a human without realizing it. Her interactions as her alter ego and the results of experiences with all sorts of people makes Vivy
        who she's become. A person would not be the same if they lived their life talking to the exact same people over and over. If a person never experienced happiness or melancholy or emptiness or hatred they would be a lesser person for it.
        This is why Vivy is what Diva can't be. This is why Vivy can save the world.
