    <p class="gridPara mediumText">
      Episode 8 keeps us within the maze still as we spend more time with the dolls that didn't get as much attention in the previous episode. We start off with Ricky and Lou as they find Rum's master
      in an interesting trap. She wasn't treated near as poorly as the others, but her rescue required a much more refined touch. In typical fashion though, Ricky arrogantly greets her before being
      whisked away by Lou. What's interesting here is that Lou begins to catch onto how Ricky goes about this sorts of things and even catches him thinking for himself. Of course to us this is nothing
      new as he does so freely with Patrick but in doing so to Lou puts himself on the ropes. Moving forward, 4 of the 5 Shadow masters have been found by someone, the last being Louise. With a stroke of
      luck Lou and Ricky see a pillar of soot rising in the distance, which Lou immediately recognizes as Louise's. Lou's certainty in the realization leaves Ricky dumbfounded until she explains how she
      knew it was Louise's, which she says she found out in the debut hall when everyone was emitting soot in a different pattern. Of course, Ricky is frustrated with himself that he didn't manage to pick
      up on this little detail but pushes it to the back of his mind as he makes his way with Lou to Louise. They soon find themselves in a garden and realize that the soot had suddenly stopped. In what is
      now classic Lou fashion, she knows exactly what her master is thinking and pretends to leave so that she'll being emitting soot once more. The trick of course works because Louise is so hopelessly
      infatuated by her face. We've known this for a while but with each interaction the relationship between the two becomes more and more perverse. Louise feels intensely narcissistic about her face and
      incredibly vain to the point of hearing Lou calms her down. It's not that Lou herself does anything in particular for Louise, but that Louise recognizes Lou as Louise and it becomes some weird possession
      and obsession of self wherein Louise is coddled by her face but also spoils her face. Between the co-dependence of Ricky and Patrick, and the odd assimilation of Lou and Louise, the relationships between
      Shadow and master have been becoming more and more disturbing to a degree.

        <p>
          Further into the episode Emilyko and Rum have to tackle the large maze that John had mentioned earlier. After a short walk the two come upon the entrance of it, only to take a single step in and realize
          that its covered from top to bottom in scorches. For those that don't remember, scorches are those things that are essentially sentient little balls of evil. They're the ones that nearly suffocated and
          hanged Rose in episode 3. Instead of one or two this time there's dozens upon dozens, it's a verifiable death trap. It's easy to forget, like in the previous episode as well, that these are in fact children
          that are undergoing these trials thanks to the fervor and confidence they tackle them with. Rest unassured though, these are still children. They are in no way adults of any form, but are still being forced
          to risk their lives nonetheless. The writing does such an excellent job of removing this notion from you mind at every turn, you almost have to keep reminding yourself that they're children and that they're
          lives are at risk with nearly every turn in this maze. Regardless of the danger however Emilyko and Rum push forward in the maze with safety thanks to Rum's memorization of the map. We quickly find out
          however that everything on the map isn't everything in the maze as the pair reach a dead end that should have been the exit. With some quick thinking and on the fly agreement from Rum (way to go Rum!) the
          duo finds the correct exit up and out of the maze and to safety.

      <p>
        After Emilyko and Rum make it out of the maze the two celebrate their success before seeing some holes cut into a hedge. Emilyko quickly realizes this as Lou's work and gets excited at the notion that they're
        indirectly helping one another. Having made it to her destination Emilyko begins to part ways with Rum before we enter a complex conversation with the two. Before the two can part Rum begins to break down at tells
        Emilyko that her Shadow master Shirley, had never given her a name. She hasn't even talked to Rum ever before. Rum breaks down completely in front of her new friend as the despair and hopelessness and desire to
        shrink away and hide washes over her. With this Rum's character finally reaches the crest, as she's let all that she has to out. Just because we know she'll be on the up and up after this doesn't mean it's any easier
        to watch. It's hard to see her break down and feel so helpless, to have no choice but to agree with all of those around her that she's useless, that her Shadow doesn't care about her. Though we can do nothing, Emilyko
        steps in to offer up some of her sunshine to Rum and gives her a new perspective on her relationship with Shirley. This perspective, paired with Emilyko's overwhelming cheerful nature manages to lift Rum out of her
        slump and she agrees to continue on her way to save her master. With this conversation our understanding of the personalities of everyone is essentially finished. Three out of the five Shadow masters fall squarely into
        the odd and dysfunctional, with one on the fence and only a single relationship being positive. Of all the Shadows and dolls in the show I can only say that John and Shaun have a positive relationship. As we saw with
        Lou and Louise theirs is perverted with narcissism and vanity with an overwhelming sense of identity, Ricky and Patrick depend on one another as the roles switch back and forth behind the scene, and Kate and Emilyko,
        these two are certainly interesting to say the least. What was first a relationship born out of necessity turned to one of desire and jealousy on Kate's end, and Emilyko sees Kate as an ideal rather than the person she
        is. She gives too much credit and sets Kate on too high a pedestal, forcing Kate away from her to a degree. Theirs is also the only relationship that operates on the basis of something close to equals, Emilyko's personality
        isn't forced to change but Kate doesn't try to act like Emilyko. As independent as the two of them are their relationship is tarnished by the requirements set. If the two were to meet as regular and normal people they'd
        be fine, but the circumstances of each's existence is what crushes their bond.

      <p>
        Episode 8 leaves us once more hanging as only 2 of the 5 Shadows have been properly reunited with their dolls. Though those two are making their way back they'll find a new challenge laying in wait for them, as Edward's been
        ordered to close off the entrances to the maze to make it harder for the pairs to return. This decision is disliked by Edward as he voices his frustration with two dolls that seem oddly familiar. You'll quickly realize thanks
        to appearance and names that these are the dolls of the 2 Shadows that appeared at the start of the previous episode. The trio enters a deep conversation while the veiled dolls begin their work of closing off the entrances.
        What's really interesting here is the way the trio talks. We find out that the three of them are from the same debut, but don't know if there were more than three pairs that existed during the debut. Even more odd is the way
        that Edward addresses the master of Shadows House, he calls him 'Lord Grandfather', a name only Shadows are allowed to use. Even weirder is he recounting of details of moving into the Lord Grandfather's wing, he talks about
        it as if it was himself that went there, not his Shadow. We've been told that Edward's a special doll, and at first I would have thought it was just because of his ability to play piano, but it might be because he's a doll
        with no Shadow Master?  That doesn't quite add up either, as he talks in distaste about the Shadows on the third floor. You'd think a doll that plays the piano and isn't bound to a Shadow would be happy to operate wherever
        he may be. The conversation fades though as Edward looks at what is essentially a skill and stat sheet for each of the Shadows. The majority of the shadows in the debut have well detailed pages about their abilities and
        skills, but there's one that has virtually no special information attached to it, and one could easily guess that it's Shirley who is the wildcard in this debut. Frustrated by the lack of certainty within the debut Edward
        begins to once more play the piano, though something happens this time. While playing the piano soot creeps up his hands and overtop of his face, engulfing Edward completely in a shadow. Once he's taken over by the Shadow he
        begins to refer to himself in the third person (like all Shadows do), but the rest of his personality doesn't change. Our final moments of the episode are with this "Edward" sitting at the piano as a helix of music notes made
        of soot rise into the air. While it might not have been the most content heavy episode ever, the slower pacing and lack of major events makes each change and difference and revelation that much more interesting and desirable to
        experience. They don't dump exciting content and fast paced action or disturbing horror on you every single episode. Instead they carefully and methodically weave a story that leaves you wondering what will happen next at each
        turn rather than what's unfolding in front of you. It's a show that thrives off of the lack of knowledge it gives viewers and forces us to play right into their hands as they feed us senses of safety and security and bits and
        pieces of information that we have to put together ourselves. It forces people to actually watch the show rather than look at all the pretty colors that flash across the screen.
