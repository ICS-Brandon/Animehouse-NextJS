    <h2 class="brightText">A Deeper Dive</h2>
    <p class="gridPara mediumText">
      The episode begins with Barbie giving a speech about the source of the soot from the previous episodes and Emilyko and co rejoicing at giving Barbie a taste of
      her own medicine. Mia in particular is very enthusiastic about it, bringing excitement and happiness to the crew. We also find out that Mia was the one that gave
      Emilyko a map which was of great help, and in return Emilyko had given her a doll. The opening moments are really cheerful and happy as Mia bids them farewell to
      head back to her room, only to be met with destruction. Upon entering her room we see it covered in soot handprints and drag marks and streaks. The only thing that has
      been actually destroyed is the doll that Emilyko made for Mia. The scene itself is excellent as it shows the aggression and wrath of Sarah while only breaking a single
      thing. It shows the absolute focus that Sarah has on Mia, and that her aggression is towards Mia herself, not Mia in general. It sounds like a slight difference but it's
      much greater than that. A bit later into the episode we see Mia asking Sarah for 'The opportunity to grow' while sitting in front of her with some sort of cane or stick
      in hand. Following this request Mia gets prepared as Sarah takes the stick in hand and begins to beat her. With each strike of the stick she instills her will, declaring
      to Mia that they must become Star Bearers and that they'll gain the favor of the Lord Grandfather. She continues to chastise her for wasting time with Emilyko and that
      Mia should serve Sarah and only Sarah. It's a very grim entrance to the episode as we see how Living Dolls can be treated and how... Involved, Shadow Masters can be
      with their Dolls, after all they are the face of their master.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        With the debut drawing close we get to have a closer look at the Dolls and their masters. We already know Kate and Emilyko quite well so we don't see much of Kate and only get
        Emilyko wondering about what's outside of Shadows House. Next on the list is seeing John and Shaun. Oddly enough John is wearing glasses to start the conversation as he tells Shaun
        to go rest before the debut. Here it's very clear that both are fairly stubborn individuals, John having a more aggressive personality opposed to Shaun's more relaxed. Despite having
        the 'dominant' personality John essentially loses the argument but gets Shaun to go to bed. Interestingly enough in the conversation John is wearing glasses in an attempt to help Shaun
        so that he can see better. What's interesting here that might not have been picked up on in the previous episode is that Shaun is a doll with bad eyesight, which raises a lot of questions
        and doubts concerning living dolls. Moving forward we see Rum and her Shadow master, Rum silently cleaning the room and preparing the bed. The Shadow master is just as silent and doesn't
        even say anything to Rum before going to sleep. On the night before the last pair we see is Patrick and Ricky. The two very much scheme while mocking the other Shadows and their dolls,
        Ricky taking the lead and given Patrick exactly what he wants. It's the first time we've seen this sort of dynamic between Shadow and Doll. Ricky takes the lead but makes it seem like
        Patrick is the one coming up with it all and wholeheartedly gives him all the recognition. On the morning of the Shadows get their Dolls prepared for the event, Lou's master being the
        first shown. Their relationship is another interesting one, Lou is essentially a blank slate for her master to impose herself on and she does just that. Lou is degraded even further as a
        doll, possessing what seems like zero free will or character, just inheriting the existence of her Shadow Master. Her master also behaves in a way that's oddly uncomfortable, like she
        loves Lou but not because Lou is Lou. It's a very perverse sense of love and admiration that she gives off while prettying Lou up for the debut.

      <p>
        The day of the debut has finally come for the young Shadow Masters and their dolls as the pairs make their way to the debut hall, only to be met by a doll of all possible living things
        in the house. The Doll, named Edward, greets the group and takes them to the debut hall where they'll begin, only they don't realize the debut has already begun. Just on their walk to
        the actual hall they're quizzed about certain topics and graded on their performance. Once they make it to the doors of the debut hall they find it to be largely empty. Upon entering
        Edward gives a small welcome to the candidates and takes some small trinkets in the shapes of the young Shadow masters in hand and places them on a decorative stand. Louise and Patrick
        are placed on a shelf together while the other 3 are placed one level below, signifying the points earned/lost during the walk to the debut hall. After seeing where they stand and what's
        happening all of the Shadows begin emitting soot. The really interesting thing here is that all the Shadow master emit soot in a different way. Louise's is emitted in a sort of curvy stream
        upwards, something fairly representative of her cutesy nature. John's crackles out of him like sparks in all directions while Kate's is a simple column upwards. Patrick's is like a haze
        around his head while Shirley doesn't emit any soot. Overall some really interesting stuff as it was incredibly easy to be tricked into thinking that all soot was emitted the same, but it
        turns out that it's closer to the overall personality of the person than anything else. Quickly, John's temper gets the best of him as he confronts Edward about the debut. Edward doesn't
        budge at the aggression and makes John quickly secede and return to the group. The group begins to fracture and move to different spaces in the hall as Kate and Louise declare they're going
        to get some food. Something that struck me in this scene, which is weird it was now of all times, is that the Shadows always refer to themselves in the third person, I can't say I've ever
        heard a Shadow refer to themselves in the first person. Moving forward though the situation quickly devolves as the two Shadows begin talking to each other and Louise starts to boast about her
        "face" causing Kate to lose interest and walk away. Patrick and Ricky enter the fray to mock Louise and Lou, with Ricky taking the lead in insults and even taking control of the conversation
        as a whole at times. Thanks to his involvement Louise and Lou rise a rank on the leaderboards. Overall these scenes are showing the relationships and personalities of the Shadow masters and
        their Dolls when mixed with others of a similar nature. Most fare alright, but Emilyko ends up leaving Kate alone a good bit of the time causing her to be jealous and anxious and even gets
        Kate to start acting like Emilyko rather than vice versa.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Kate and Emilyko's bond as servant and master is on the ropes as they fall another level on the shelf and Kate becomes even more upset, her soot emanating in a more curly and disorganized manner
        as she mulls over Emilyko's personality. A distraction occurs when Edward begins to play the piano however and the Shadows and their Dolls make their way over to begin dancing. As the pairs
        begin to dance Kate gives us some insight to the pairs. Louise leading Lou with every move and Lou completely surrendering control to her master, meanwhile Ricky and Patrick are much more in synch
         as they take turns leading one another, though Ricky does it to give Patrick attention. After seeing Emilyko's reaction to a comment from Shaun, Kate finally begins to understand and accept Emilyko
         as she is. With a hearty chuckle and allowing Emilyko to be herself she wraps her soot around Emilyko's legs and they begin a dance. The moment itself is truly beautiful and the animation and visuals
         make it so much better, the sunlight breaking the through the window to glaze everything over in happiness and brightness. While you easily get the sense that the bond between the two has increased
         greatly in these few moments it's hard to not think of the words that Kate says as something more. It simply feels like there's more to the words she speaks about Emilyko and herself, and after all
         the interaction with the other Shadows and Dolls it seems oddly uncomfortable to listen to despite it's obviously pure nature and intention. As quickly as the music begins it ends, Edward slamming on
         the keys. Still frustrated with the debut John confronts Edward which causes Edward to show all the shadows the garden outside of the debut hall, leaving the dolls behind and ending the episode. The
         complexity of the interactions and dynamics of the Shadow masters and their dolls is excellently done. There's plenty of room for friendships and rivalries and gives us plenty of information to build
         upon in terms of relationships. The most concerning in my opinion being that of Louise and Lou. It's Lou's nature to submit, and Louise's nature to dominate and control but their dynamic just feels
         incorrect and uncomfortable to experience. The episode leaves us what seems to be roughly midway through the debut and with Kate and Emilyko in a precarious position, though the two have strengthened
         their bond and Kate has a few tricks up her sleeve so we'll see what they can manage next time.
