    <h2 class="brightText">Conflict Brews And Solutions Arise</h2>
    <p class="gridPara mediumText">
      At the start of the episode we stay with the Dolls as they discuss what to do with their Shadow Masters being taken away from them to outside. Shaun shows his worth as the critical
      thinker in the group as he attempts to break down what's going on at the moment, unwittingly setting off Ricky when questioning why he was demoted. Lou dutifully answers that it's
      because Ricky took the initiative to dance with his Shadow Master. This of course causes Ricky to claim that it's unfair, only to be met with comments from Lou once more about the
      nature of Living Dolls. Interestingly enough only two dolls are given closeups during this comment, Lou and Rum. The reason for this is quite obvious, they are the only two entirely
      subservient to their Shadow Master whereas the other three have a different relationship. Not exactly a huge revelation but a cool little piece to add to the puzzle. Speaking of puzzle,
      after the opening rolls the group is back to thinking of how to solve the predicament they're in, Shaun taking the lead once more. In attempting to find a solution Ricky and Shaun argue
      again and have it broken up by Emilyko. Ricky takes offense and mocks Emilyko, who sees no issue with it as she happily sips her tea and eats her snacks, until she bites into something
      that isn't food. Hidden in one of the treats is a Feve, a good luck charm made out of porcelain. Upon closer inspection the charm has writing atop it and Shaun realizes that Edward said
      to 'Eat their sweets'. Cracking the code the group gets to devouring an unhealthy amount of desert to discover all the pieces of the puzzle. Stumped at the message on the set of charms,
      of which there are 5 with different shapes and flowers on them (hint, Roses are Kate), an idea arises in Emilyko's head. She takes the charms and walks to the door where she places them
      in a small cutout, causing the door to open and allowing the Dolls to pass.

    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:6%">Edward's Fury And An Infinite Maze</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Upon the success of Emilyko unlocking the door we find Edward waiting outside in the garden for them, visibly upset. As we heard in earlier episodes Edward is attempting to make himself
        stand out to the Lord Grandfather so he can improve his standing and move closer to him. With how all of the dolls and shadows have been acting he's upset with himself. His antics have only
        improved the bonds of Shadow and Doll as well as improving the morale of the groups. As the group draws closer he laments over his actions and what he should do next, being unfairly harsh and
        eliminating without cause doesn't get him attention and letting everyone pass makes him look like he doesn't care. He quickly recomposes himself before the group makes it to in front of him.
        When the group gets to him he tells them of their next task: to save their Shadow Master. A special rule he imposes upon them is that no harm can come to a living doll's face, and that a
        Shadow's attire must not get dirty. With that in mind he's nearly ready to set the Dolls loose, but must allow them the choice of a single item that is displayed before them. The dolls that
        ranked higher in the earlier sections get first choice above lower ranked ones. Lou starts and picks a pair of large hedge shears. Next is Shaun and Ricky who bicker back and forth about who
        gets to pick first as they assume they're both aiming for the same object. A suggestion from Emilyko however proves that they weren't, as they both blurt out different items at the same time,
        Ricky taking a Soot Coat and Shaun a magnifying glass. Next is Rum who chooses a lamp, followed by Emilyko who picks a small wooden push carriage of all possible things. With that Edward tells
        the dolls to get ready, each of them standing at an entrance to the maze, and then sends them off on their mission.

        With Edward's signal the Dolls rush into the maze to find and return with their masters in the allotted two hours they have. Emilyko and Rum end up working together as they cross paths early in their
        searches. Ricky is next to meet someone as Lou comes bursting through a hedge directly in front of him, catching him off guard. Taking advantage of Lou's personality he gets her to work with him in
        finding their Shadow Masters, the only one left out thus far being Shaun. In a heartfelt moment Rum and Emilyko happen upon a large hill they must go up. Emilyko struggles most of the way upwards as
        Rum awkwardly watches on, it's only once Emilyko stumbles and nearly gets dragged all the way back down the hill that Rum steps in. Overcoming her anxiety and avoidance she stands beside Emilyko as
        the pair push the cart up the hill, resulting in a successful triumph when they reach the top. While taking a rest the two hear and feel a massive explosion in the distance, startling them. Taken to
        the scene of the explosion we find shattered wood littered about in a cloud of soot. Quickly we find out that John is, to some degree, responsible for the explosion. In the background of him standing
        up we can see more remnants of the box and make out pieces of metal that striped across it, though they're now bent out of shape and holding on for dear life. Seeing John covered in soot it becomes clear
        that he has some control over soot and that he was able to make it explode. We have no idea how he could make soot explode but there's one idea that sticks out to most that was shown in the last episode.
        Shaun's soot emanated from his head in a very unique pattern, behaving like it was sparks or something similar. In that vein of thought it's easy to believe that the way his soot is released has something
        to do with his control over it. Our next view is of Kate in a large bird cage, significantly more sturdy than the box that John was in. Seeing it you can't help but think that Edward or some high-ranking
        Shadow knows of the abilities of the young masters on trial. While brooding about what to do John strolls up to Kate's cage and offers to get her out, if she'll marry him. In their conversation she figures
        out that John was able to control soot to some degree to make his way out, though it's not much of a challenge to figure out as he boasts quite proudly about it. After John takes his leave Kate is back
        to thinking, her thoughts spilling out as she believes the debut is like some sort of spectacle and that people are watching. As soon as she finishes that sentence we see pawns moving on a map, a group
        of Shadows surrounding it having a candid chat about the candidates.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        This episode might have felt painfully slow to some considering how little actually occurs in it, but the payoff is in the long haul. From the start Shadows House has made clear it's not a single or perhaps even
        2 season story, they've committed to the long term in the level of detail and information they give us viewers in something that feels incredibly close to its roots. There are the smallest bits of information and
        dialogue that eat up time in the show and all sorts of unneeded fat around the edges. It's this fat and these necessary pieces that makes it so satisfying to watch. It's not a 20 minute slug-fest nor is it 20
        minutes of exposition from various characters explaining their motives, nor 20 minutes of fan service. It's 20 minutes a week dedicated to telling a well and proper mystery story and cuts no corners in what modern
        anime is expected to. The dedication to following each and every small detail despite not being packed with action or drama or horror takes a lot of courage and one can only hope it pays off and that the series
        continues. With that in mind though it's not like we don't get action or horror or anything of the sort, and I have a feeling in the next episode or two we'll get plenty of all of it. Shadows House has thus far been
        an incredibly satisfying and refreshing series to watch against the common tropes and tricks of modern anime and something I look forward to experiencing and breaking down every week.
