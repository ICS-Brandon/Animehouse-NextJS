    <h2 class="brightText">Everybody's Special</h2>
    <p class="gridPara mediumText">
      Episode 7 continues with where Episode 6 left off as we meet once more with some of the more high ranking shadows. In our short time at the beginning of the episode we get to find out some
      interesting information about Shadows. Each Shadow's power is different.... Mostly likely. I say this because each Shadow is only shown to have a singular power in use so far and seeing the
      higher ranking ones it would make sense. The only thing that might counteract this is the two new powers we see are wielded by what look like younger/lower ranking Shadows. With that in mind
      it might just be the higher ups using the lower ranked. However we have a few details that might say otherwise and keep us on the straight and narrow for each having a unique ability. The
      first Shadow controls the pieces on the board that the other Shadows are looking at but nothing seems special about his appearance. It's only with the girl Aileen that we are given our hint.
      Aileen produces a soot pigeon that delivers a message to Edward (very interesting power I might add). Aileen's outfit is very interesting as it has something similar to a bird's tail on the
      back and the sleeves hang loose to produce a look reminiscent of wings. Most importantly, Aileen produces the soot for the pigeon from her breath, which is a feat that we haven't seen yet. All
      of these point towards each Shadow having a power that is as unique as their personality, and there's a lot of unique personalities in these new Shadows. On the topic of personalities the two
      Shadows sat on the right side of the board (Ryan and Dorothy) show theirs as they witness Shaun meet up with Rum and Emilyko. The two are very over the top, cruel, evil, and grand. Exactly how
      you'd expect a Shadow to behave, the two sitting opposite of them however are far more reserved and objective, causing them to be the objects of Ryan and Dorothy's discontent.

    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:6%">Children Subjected To Trials</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        It's incredibly easy to forget the dangers and tribulations that these children have to face during this debut thanks to their willingness to participate. To put it into perspective there's been
        something like 3 near death experiences between last and this episode. Whichever way you look at it these children have been forced to play a role in the sick games of those that lord over them.
        The first person that makes you realize this is Patrick. Trapped in his box, all alone without Ricky he loses his composure, and for a moment you see Patrick as you should see him, a child. There's
        no other way around it these Shadows are not adults and neither are their dolls but they are being treated as such all the same. It can be overwhelming, especially in the case of Patrick as he depends
        so heavily on Ricky. Funny enough as well, Ricky is another place we get to see their innocence and naivety shine through. After nearly dying Lou gets Ricky to make sure her face isn't damaged at
        all and gets right up close with him so that he can check. Of course to Lou this means nothing but Ricky becomes flustered and distracted with being able to see so up close. That's right, despite the
        interactions of so many of the dolls, they are devoid of romance. Even the Shadows seem to be so far, though they have their reasons (Sweet Home Alabama plays in the background). When we come back to
        Emilyko and Co. and even meet up with John once more you'd be forgiven for forgetting these are children. They're so calm and collected in the face of such a dangerous challenge that it's simply not
        something that comes across your mind. It takes a childish or impulsive act to bring you back to reality, like with Ricky and Patrick, or even John when he realizes he accidentally proposed to Kate and
        desperately wants to forget that memory. Whether this writing is intentional or not it adds to the mounting concern and horror of the series. It's hard to believe it's been over 3 episodes since the
        Phantom Incident, which still haunts the memories of many a viewer. It's still such a shock, and even more so cause for concern since it's been so long since it happened. Horror lurks around every corner
        in the show and while you may realize that every so often, the characters and story do such a terrifyingly good job of giving you a false sense of safety and luring you away from worrying about what
        happens next.

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        There couldn't be a better heading than this for episode 7 as the dolls find their way through the maze. Again, it's incredibly easy to lose yourself in the lightheartedness and triumphant moments the cast
        shares but there's so much more to it. Patrick's desperation to be saved is clawing away at his sanity before Emilyko makes a stop at his crate and talks with him. In this short conversation he gathers his
        composure and even matures a little. He begins to find himself and put his trust in Ricky, and begins to slowly move away from codependency, albeit bit by bit. When spending our time with Emilyko and Co. we
        get to see Shaun warm up a little and make some fairly substantial, though easily missed, changes. The biggest of these changes would be in the moment that John finds the group towards the end of the episode.
        Despite having already found his master and knowing the next steps to take he still offers his help to Emiylko. Before Shaun wouldn't have hesitated to leave if it had anything to do with his master, but here
        and now he changes. He's become more compassionate for others and has a stronger sense of helping other people. Considering how hard set he was in the beginning of serving his master, his openness to providing
        aid to the detriment of himself and his master is quite the feat for him. The last significant bit of development for characters is with Rum. In the last episode she helped Emilyko get her cart up the hill and
        she still isn't slowing down. Rather than allow herself to be the shy one that has a hard time talking she shows her compassion and wits by giving her spare map Shaun after she memorized the whole thing. Quite
        the astonishing feat for sure, but she's also become more confident in herself and more willing to be a part of the team. From where she started, crying on the ground while being bullied by all those around
        her, to being an integral part of her group and supporting everyone is really satisfying to see. The next hurdle for her of course is saving her Shadow master, but I have faith in Rum and believe she'll keep
        growing and find a way to overcome the obstacle!

        Episode 7 doesn't leave us much to talk on. It was mostly used for developing characters and the story more. There wasn't much action, there wasn't any horror, no new terrible rules or limitations imposed. You might
        even be thinking that it was a waste of an episode, and that's where I'd disagree. This is exactly the sort of episodes we need to see more of in anime. An episode that drives the story and characters forward without
        any major events. Not everything in a show needs to be a big deal or incredibly noteworthy, these little "insignificant" moments provide important details and information that you don't get otherwise. They give more
        depth to all the characters, they provide a better understanding of the worldbuilding at play, they keep you on your toes for what's going to happen next. They aren't "just for show" and they certainly aren't a waste
        of time. You can learn so much from these slower 20 minutes, you can find so many small details of importance when you aren't worrying about catching all the major bits of action, you even get a better perspective of
        the characters involved. 20 minutes of daily life is just as valuable as 20 minutes chock full of progression and heavy storylines. Each has their own purposes, but as anime has shifted to flashy one and done seasonal
        approaches we've lost those bits of in between. We've lost the leisure of having more time to build a story, and shows have become an advertising platform for their associated content. Shadows House refuses to play by
        these rules and commits to being a full-bodied translation of its source material, and I can't appreciate that enough.
