    <h2 class="brightText">Establishing A Social Hierarchy</h2>
    <p class="gridPara mediumText">
      The Living Dolls exist to serve their masters and are direct subordinates to them, but what happens when the master isn't around to give orders? Episode
      4 gives us some insight into what happens when the dolls are left to their own devices and have to govern themselves. Unsurprisingly there's a social hierarchy
      within the dolls, and while it does take the majority of its setup from the hierarchy and positions of their Shadow masters there's room for their standing to
      move up and down to a degree. At the top commanding all the dolls in their cleaning is the Star Bearer, Barbie. It's safe to say her Shadow Master has very high
      standing which is why her position is absolute, and that she gets to do what she wants. During her beratement of the dolls for allowing a Phantom to coalesce we
       get to see a bit of how the dolls interact with each other. Mia herself stands up to the harassment of Barbie and in turn gets punished for it, starting a small
       scuffle between the group and her. The majority of the dolls look on as the group tries to defend themselves, but a singular male doll named Shaun steps in and
       "accidentally" knocks Barbie over, who is subsequently caught by a blonde haired doll named Ricky. The situation devolves further as Ricky punches Shaun for
       Barbie and insults him. There's very much a strong social dynamic in the dolls, and while it takes heavily from the dynamics of the Shadow family there's still
       much room to grow and improve, as Ricky shows. Ricky and his master have not had their debut yet Ricky already curries favor with a higher ranking doll such
       as the Star Bearer Barbie.

    <h2 class = "brightText" style="padding-top:6%">Unfair Punishment And An Upcoming Debut</h2>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        Thanks to the intervention of Emilyko and Shaun, and the unfortunate blunder of the doll that dropped a container of soot, these three dolls are assigned to a
        night watch to find the source of the soot that created the Phantom. Mia immediately points out the fact that Barbie is simply abusing the dolls and using her
        power to unfairly punish them without a justification for it. As is par for the course with Mia she tells Emilyko she shouldn't get involved in affairs of others
        before Rose steps in to make light of the situation to keep spirits high. After the dolls are finished their cleaning activities they return to their masters'
        rooms. Here Kate asks Emilyko is she's available to study that night for the debut where she must decline due to her night duty. Clearly this upsets Kate and
        makes her anxious as the debut looms closer and closer. Next we get to see Ricky talking to his Shadow master, Patrick. It's here you get an understanding of
        the kind of characters Ricky and Patrick are. The two of them are very undercutting and mischievous, but only ever punch down. They brown nose those above them
        by dehumanizing those below and devoting themselves to the shadows that stand above them. Oddly enough however it feels like Ricky acts on his own for the sake
        of his master, rather than his master telling Ricky how to act. Next we're shown to the unspoken pair of the doll who dropped her container and her shadow master.
        The two don't say a word to each other as the Shadow studies for the debut, it's clear by the expression of the doll that she wishes to speak to her master but
        hasn't been able to yet. While the doll clearly has social anxiety it's unknown if the master exhibits the same or is simply antisocial.

        <h2 class = "brightText">A Better Understanding Of The Supporting Cast</h2>
        <p>
          While the night watch is an arduous task for the dolls Emilyko starts it off lightheartedly by introducing herself, and while it's very much a strenuous assignment
          for the dolls it serves to give us a better introduction to Shaun and the third doll with them. Overall the nights of searching that the dolls do is very lighthearted
          and gives us more insight into the dolls with Emilyko. Some comical moments arise as well thanks to Shaun not having good eyesight and mistaking mounted animal heads
          for Emilyko. Very quickly however their nights of searching take a toil on themselves as they are staying up for days at a time now. One night Shaun brings blankets
          for the trio to sleep in and hits the nail on the head for the explanation of their duties. He says that they need to better serve their shadow masters rather than do
          what Barbie says, and that she does it purely to disrupt the relationship between doll and master. Clearly Shaun is very much an objective and logical doll dedicated
          to serving his master. However, he isn't as zealous as Ricky and doesn't turn a blind eye to fellow dolls. As the three tuck in for some well deserved sleep, the third
          doll finally breaks down. You can't help but feel sorrow for the dolls as tears roll down her face and she profusely apologizes. Quickly though Emilyko erases those
          feelings from the doll and we learn her name, Rum. During her introduction the the other two dolls Rum runs off when she's scared by what turns out to be a veiled doll
          that comes down the hallway. Now instead of sleeping away the night Emilyko and Shaun search for Rum. While the two search for her we stay with Rum as she hides in fear.
          Watching her character is really hard as she tries her best to be hopeful and positive but is unable to shed the horrid thoughts that plague her mind. "Happy? I don't
          know what it feels like to be happy.". Quickly however we return to Shaun and Emilyko searching for Rum as they navigate the dangerous mansion. At one point they enter
          a hallway that leads to the front entrance of the mansion, which ends up being trapped so that anyone trying to leave or escape is dealt with. Thankfully, Shaun and
          Emilyko are able to find Rum relatively quickly, and in finding Rum they actually find the source of the soot as well. With that their nightly duties are finally finished!

    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        While the trio celebrates their victory in discovering the source of the soot we move over to Kate to find her studying for the debut while still emitting soot, clearly
        anxious about the fact that she's been unable to spend any time with Emilyko to prepare. Even though the debut is so close no information is known to the viewers and to
        any of the characters. There's also the question of what will come of befriending two of the other living dolls that will be taking part in the debut. The two are also
        featured in the opening alongside characters like Lou and Ricky so they will be important characters to some degree. With the discovery of the scorches a new question
        popped into my head as well. With the collection of all of the soot, where does it go? It's collected and transported somewhere, but the question is where? Does it get
        repurposed? Does it have to be separated into the smallest possible pieces and disposed? Is it used as a tool or weapon by the Shadow family? As per usual with Shadows
        House you leave the episode with more questions than you entered with. That alone makes it such an interesting series to watch, there's always something else to uncover,
         always something more complex at work.
