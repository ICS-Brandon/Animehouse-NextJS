    <h2 class="brightText">The Advance Party</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      The episode starts us off with two more, presumably, British vampires, each with a young man in tow. The two women share many similar traits in terms of looks and styling,
      signaling that they're fairly high up in British society, but they differ in what might be the most important aspect in terms of vampires. Their pupils are different colors.
      The one woman sports blue eyes, a similar color to those of Defrott and Suwa, while the other wears green like the eyes that Rufus possesses. On the topic of Rufus he appears
      in front of the two ladies to regretfully inform them that he has no more space for their "guests" and that they must restrain themselves. The two women disregard his comment
      and bring the boys with them regardless. They talk down to Rufus as its made apparent that he's a servant to these two, and they even go as far as to tell us that he was the
      one that developed Ascra. The interesting part here is that one of the women shares the same eye color as Rufus, yet is apparently higher in the pecking order comparatively.
      It removes all doubts about the possibility of eye color being related to ranking (though Suwa made that one apparent), and instead pivots closer to something caused by the
      time period they were bitten in. It's hard to know without the ages of these vampires, but still an interesting thought. Speaking of Defrott as well the two women don't hold
      him in high regard, referencing him as a 'brat', whereas Rufus refers to him with the honorific "-sama".  In the ending moments of our time at the start of the episode we also
      get to see Rufus' vampire mark, which rests on the left side of his neck just poking out from behind the collar of his outfit. We're still left in the dark on what the meaning
      of these markings is and what sort of, if any, significance they hold to the user in regards to unique abilities or powers.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The middle of the episode aims to give more perspective and information between acts as we visit Colonel Maeda in the hospital where Aoi is paying a visit. She attempts to get
        some information from him with no luck and he ends up with a pile of letters in his hands by the time she leaves. Inspecting the letters closer he realizes one of them is from
        Misaki. It's here we find out that Misaki is Nakajima's daughter and that she begs him to stop her father from employing whatever plot he's set into motion. While it's not a
        shocking twist by any means it's definitely something that fits better in a theatrical style which works perfectly given how Mars Red handles itself. The revelation doesn't seem
        out of place or incorrect, just a little cliche if anything. After reading the letter Maeda leaves the hospital to go to the theater where it all began. While he is there he ends
        up meeting Defrott once more and correctly labels him as a vampire. Here, Defrott mulls over the memory of sharing his blood with Misaki to bring her back to life while talking
        to Maeda. There's almost a tinge of regret in the voice of Defrott for his actions in saving Misaki, though he doesn't act on them as he leaves as quickly as he appeared. Our final
        piece before entering the climax of the episode is our time with Nakajima, and subsequently Rufus. Earlier on Nakajima is given a shortened schedule and reduced budget to enact
        his vampire unit plan by Okimura. Moving foward we find Nakajima reminiscing over an old picture that contains some young men, one of them being Maeda. While looking at the picture
        he's alerted to Maeda's departure from the hospital. In the time after Maeda's meeting with Defrott we get a brief glimpse of Rufus serving the high ranking vampires before being
        summoned to deal with a body. While disposing of the body he lets his distaste for these vampires slip and gives a hint to the viewers of his involvement in a double crossing. After
        the moment with Rufus we see Nakajima in front of a series of soldiers in some bulky looking suits. He gives a small speech before making a toast to his men. The men all drink from
        a similar cup to Nakajima's and in one scene you can see it to be Ascra, in Nakajima's however it's simply Sake. Here we enter the climb towards the peak of the episode as the unit
        moves to carry out an 'extermination' in Yokohama.

      <p class = "mediumText">
        After Nakajima's command for what seemed to be a vampire unit to move out we catch up with Code Zero, who are in a small boat of all things. We quickly listen in on their conversation
        as they move to make landfall on the warehouse they had pinpointed the location of between last episode and this. Yamagami makes a comment about vampire's aversion to water and asks who's
        plan it was to go by water. Takeuchi cheerfully answers that it was of course Maeda's idea. In their talking we learn that the warehouse was a front for foreign trade and temporarily
        storing imported goods. It's safe to say when they said goods they meant vampires. Takeuchi also excitedly tells us that the warehouse is crawling with S class vampires. Finally making
        landfall Code Zero splits in two with Suwa and Shutaro infiltrating the factory and Takeuchi and Yamagami watching the exit, armed with a large mounted machine gun. Despite the information
        they were given when the pair breaks into the warehouse they find it to be nearly uninhabited. They finally make their way to the basement only to find out that all the high ranking vampires
         are dead, all stuck in similar positions with their mouth agape and bearing their fangs. While all is well with Suwa and Shutaro they're quickly alerted by Takeuchi that a hoard of unranked
         vampires is attempting to attack their group. Just as vampires begin to make it past the two on guard duty (thanks to the machine gun overheating) Shutaro makes an appearance with Suwa to
         clean up the last of them that made it out the exit Takeuchi and Yamagami were watching. While attempting to fight off the massive hoard and stop them from spreading into the city, a large
         train rolls up that looks awfully familiar. From the train a series of boxes are placed on the ground, the doors popping off to reveal the vampire unit from Nakajima's speech. Seeing the unit
         and their state of disarray Code Zero decides to investigate further, Suwa and Takeuchi splitting off to follow the unit while Shutaro and Yamagami head back to Maeda to report on what's
         happening.

      <p>
        After the Extermination of Yokohama we meet with Nakajima and Okimura the next day as Okimura airs out his frustration with the Nakajima about his rash actions the night before. Unfortunately
        Nakajima doesn't appreciate the criticism nor the attitude and shoots Okimura. In the end we find out that Nakajima has had a hand to play in the distribution and use of Ascra in Japan, as he's
        being working behind the scenes with Rufus. Both these men deceiving those around them to create their own plans, it's only a question of which crosses the other in the end. Defrott also seems to
        be aware of the state of things as he watches on from atop the city. The only people that seem to be missing the memo of how things are progressing is Code Zero and their leader, Maeda. We will
        soon find out however how everything here falls into place and where it leaves Code Zero and the vampire unit. Are we looking at an invasion of vampires from overseas? A homegrown rebellion against
        Nakajima's unit? The possibilities of strife to arise for the latter half of the season are endless as restlessness grows amongst all involved, which will hopefully allow us to see some amazing
        vampire fights. Until now the show has been relatively slow paced, methodically placing action scenes here and there so viewers don't lose interest, but I have a feeling the rest of the season will
        move noticeably quicker than the first. Whether that means we get the same style and beauty of the former half is unknown, but I hold my hopes high with how well we've been treated so far in watching
        the story of Code Zero unfold.
