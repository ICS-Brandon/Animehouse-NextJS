    <h2 class="brightText">A Question That Is The Answer</h2>
    <p class="mediumText">
      The start of the episode begins with us learning about what happened to the flock of Radon from the previous episode. Once again we meet with the head scientist who
      talks about the Radon and find the journalist that had met with Mei is there as well. He seems to play the Devil's Advocate as he asks leading questions like "Will
      more of these giant creatures be visiting us soon? For example, a wingless terrestrial creature that walks on four- or even two legs.". He speaks with such swagger
      and calmness that it's almost like he already knows the answer to that question, the look on his face after asking making it plain to see he's thinking ahead of what
      he has asked. Soon after we come back to Mei attempting to solve the code that Yun had sent to her. She debates back and forth with her AI, confused that if it's
      supposed to make sense when it's solved that it should be solvable. Quickly though her AI companion Pero 2 picks up on the fact that it's a hash, choosing to try MD5
      first. Anyone remotely familiar with hashing will know where this is going right away but those that don't get lead on for a little bit as Mei attempts various words
      and sentences to output the correct value. For those not familiar with hashing all that well we get a cute little explanation from Pero 2 likening it to hash browns,
      "It would be difficult to restore the original potato from a hash brown. It's only towards the end of the episode Mei cracks the code when assuming her suitcase to be
      locked. "But how can a suitcase be locked if the key is inside?", the answer being that the suitcase isn't locked. In the end the MD5 hash was a quiz for Mei to give
      her a better understanding of what Archetype is, a question that's the answer. Something that is unable to exist but does anyway, something that couldn't be discovered
      but was anyway.

    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
      <p>
        The show has been thriving on giving the viewer as many view points and perspectives as possible and continues to do so this episode. In the beginning we meet a new Kaiju
        with the fisherman from earlier, and after the opening we're taken directly to the media covering the Radon flock incursion. Immediately the screen shows a large group of
        Radon corpses being lined up on a beach, their blood or whatever liquid it may be darkening the sand around them. The media gives some numbers for the invasion of Radon as
        Yun and Haberu attempt a half-baked setup for Misakioku, believing them to be the source of the song. Quickly however, Satou dispels all concerns the two had about them. We
        of course meet with the head scientist, which was outlined earlier. Skipping further in after our problem solving session with Mei we come back to the media covering the Radon,
        asking more sensational questions than ever, with even more questionable sources and information. Quickly social media run away with the information that the media gives them
        and come up with all sorts of ideas, some more meaningful than others. The point here being that the show is giving us as much information as possible without making a single
        character all knowing, and also throwing us off the trail of the truth as everyone's ideas and opinions aren't guaranteed to line up easily for us. It makes for a satisfying game
        of Cat And Mouse mixed with searching for a needle in a haystack. You know where the story is going roughly but you don't know which thread to pull on that will lead you to the
        correct answer.

      <h2 class = "brightText" style = "padding-top:6%">Bones With Will And Trapping Light</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "gridPara mediumText">
        <p class = "gridPara mediumText">
          Failing to have caught Misakoku red handed they opt to meet with Satou at the mass gravesite of the Radon. Here Yun and Haberu talk back and forth about how quickly the Radon have
          adapted to their environment, citing the possibility that they can evolve at will. While in thought Satou drives up to them to further discuss the musical incident, accidentally revealing
          the bones in the basement of Misakioku. After Satou quickly leaves Yun notices that a Radon corpse is missing before we get to meet Professor Li and see archetype in action for the first
          time. We get to see an awe-inspiring demonstration of the ability of archetype as it traps light in a system, and then that same light increases in intensity until the demonstration
          shatters itself. In the meanwhile Mei thinks to herself as to the cause of this nature, and finds the answer right away. The light isn't trapped in the system, it's appearing in the system
          an infinite amount of times from the future. The light exhibited exists in our present but being able to trap it and increase its intensity is from the light of the future materializing
          in that specific position, creating the illusion of growing in intensity. In very cute fashion Mei becomes embarrassed due to her outburst in explaining her theory and sits back down until
          the presentation is done. Afterwards she talks with Li a little bit and gets the assignment of writing a report on her theory to give to her tomorrow. After her talk with Li we move back to
          Yun and Haberu as they cross paths with the journalist in their search for the missing Radon. Incidentally they're lead right towards it as the military ended up finding the not-so-Radon
          first, giving their position to the three thanks to some gunfire.

      <p>
        The episode gives us a lot to digest: time travelling light, bones with will, forceful evolution, resurrection, the list keeps going on. Despite the vast area that these topics cover they all
        intertwine with one another, the question of one being the answer of the next and vice versa. Right and wrong and question and answer are flipped upside down as we learn more about Archetype
        and the kaiju, putting us squarely in the territory of a theoretical fantasy. The characters provide no shortage of insight and interest in the world around them and gives us a better perspective
        of what goes on without exposing every last bit of information through a single character. Even with as many primary characters as there are we still know hardly anything about the things we've been
        exposed to so far. We're still playing catch up alongside the characters in this hectic world despite everything, and that's what makes it compelling. There's not a single moment where you come out
        ahead of the characters in terms of knowledge, there's not a moment where you know exactly where they're going with the information and what will happen next. Despite being a show about learning an
        understanding what's going on we learn and know surprisingly little so far.
