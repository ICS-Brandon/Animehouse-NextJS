          The Faraway Paladin is an interesting series due to its heritage. Originally conceived roughly 7 years ago at the time of writing this as practice, being heavily inspired by Mushoku
          Tensei it’s not what you’d call a masterpiece or Yanagino Sensei’s Magnum Opus. What it is though is a great amalgamation of all sorts of fantasies and stories. I’ve already said that
          it was heavily inspired by Mushoku Tensei, which is largely common knowledge, but not everyone might know of the traces of Lord of The Rings or the hints of Dungeons and Dragons within
          it. It’s a wonderful weaving of all sorts of pieces of all sorts of media that manages to find its own ground to stand on without completely shedding its inspiration. Viewers and/or
          readers be warned however, it’s not some crazy action-packed isekai series that relies on attachment to a previous life or experience. It’s slow, very slow compared to other anime,
          and to most people that know of the roots of The Faraway Paladin that should bring a smile to your face and a sigh of relief, but if you find more sluggish pacing frustrating you
          probably won’t find this show too enjoyable. Really at the end of the day it depends on which side of anime/media you prefer to be on. If you wanted a 12 episode series that concludes
          everything within that short time frame and moves at breakneck pace both in terms of story and action you won’t be left satisfied by this. It’s a long arcing story, an epic fantasy
          tale that won’t be concluded so easily, nor will it move linearly along itself. It’s also not the most visually outstanding series ever unfortunately. You can’t expect something to
          have everything you want, and as much as I can preach about the story and its characters and world, the art and animation isn’t anything out of this world, specifically the latter.
          It’s relatively middle of the ground, and unless you think animation is everything, it doesn’t take anything away from the series.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Is It An Isekai?</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          One of the first thoughts in my mind when watching The Faraway Paladin early on was, ‘Is this really an Isekai?’. Technically speaking it’s undeniably one, Will’s consciousness
          comes from ‘our world’ and he still has memories or at the very least an understanding of his previous life. So why would you think it’s not an Isekai? Well that’s because of
          how little importance his previous life plays in this story. In the same trend that’s happened with a lot of the non-video game Isekai series of recent times, Will’s previous
          life plays little to no importance in this world, except for where it counts. There’s a handful of moments where Will’s regret and his feelings from his previous life bleed
          through and really make a substantial impact on his character and the story, but not in the conventional way. It’s very vague and nondescript, but works very well as it deals
          largely with emotions. He’s not upset because of something he did in his previous life, but rather how he *felt* in his previous life. It’s a really nice detail and tonal shift
          from how Isekai typically deal with similar scenes and plot points. So why would I have a hard time calling it an isekai then? Everything’s there to support it. The answer’s a
          bit complicated, but finds its roots in what ‘Isekai’ are generally like. When you think of Isekai nowadays you think of a title longer than your average sentence that summarizes
          the entirety of its first act and employs cookie cutter aspects with a unique twist. The Faraway Paladin is none of that, and I’ve continually said that I feel it has stronger
          roots in Western Fantasy than it does in Japanese Isekai. It has the apprentice of the old guard preparing himself to take on their old foe, a pantheon of Gods that behave like
          Gods rather than whimsical spirits, and a world that moves despite what the main character may do. Right away the only similarity between this Isekai and any other is the title
          of the genre and the fact that Will had lived a life once before this one, but even that has doubt shrouding it, as Gracefeel is loosely associated as the Goddess of
          Reincarnation. So for any readers that have made it this far in spite of their distaste for Isekai series, let me assure you that The Faraway Paladin is Isekai only in name
          in this modern era. It refuses the vast majority of tropes and cliches and issues of modern isekai, and forges its own path of fantasy and fiction, which just so happens to
          have a main character who’s been reincarnated.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">The 48 Laws Of Power</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Perhaps the hardest part of any action based series is the power of the main character. Weakness is largely frowned upon by almost any anime viewer but at the same time making your
          lead character overpowered takes the tenseness out of a story and forces writing around the character to try and make it interesting in other ways. In an odd way The Faraway Paladin
          manages a balance of these two challenges. Will is still not strong enough to defeat the High King, this world’s ‘Demon Lord’ who’s been sealed for hundreds of years, but he stands
          head and shoulders above the rest of the human inhabitants of the modern era. Well, bar a single mysterious character that we get introduced to towards the end. I’m never really a
          fan of overpowered characters unless done out of parody like Saitama or Saiki, so I was relatively satisfied with how Will is handled in the story. He’s trained by *the* heroes of
          old, and as is standard of Isekai main characters, is undoubtedly strong. His strength isn’t just raw power though, nor is it endless wit carried over from his previous life. His
          power is learnt, engrained upon him by his adoptive parents and grandparent over the course of his childhood. It’s something he’s born with one way or another obviously, but he
          doesn’t find a loophole in training or in his abilities that a deity imparted upon him when he was reincarnated. No, Will earns his ability over several years of training under
          the best, and still he doesn’t reach the heights of the likes of Gus or Blood. There’s only one real moment where I feel Will’s ability and nature is betrayed, and that is in his
          fight with the wyvern at Whitesails. The majority of the fight is well done and executed, very well calculated and planned. But the ending left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.
          All of the planning and thinking to end the fight with overwhelming brute strength feels a little betraying, but I can’t quite disagree with it either. It’s a hard thing to judge
          when you’re comparing Will to heroes that lived 200 years ago and a hugely popular adventure that has effectively ‘one shot’ everything offscreen. Despite that slightly head scratching
          moment though, Will’s strength is used in great fashion in the following combat of the final episodes, which will be covered next.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Memento Mortuus</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The overarching meaning of importance to The Faraway Paladin, if one had to absolutely be chosen, is ‘Ensure you live life with no regrets, experience it to the fullest and find your
          happiness’. It’s something that carries a large amount of importance early on as Will faces the truth of his existence with his adoptive family, and has to witness their deaths. He faces
          incredible amounts of regret and sorrow for the life that he previously lived, and those emotions have shaped Will’s current life a great deal. It’s a really great theme to build a
          character off of, especially in an Isekai, and gives a more positive and healthy spin to the rampant escapism typically used in the genre. Will’s feelings of regret and sorrow and
          loneliness are explored relatively conservatively on average, but there are a handful of moments that really shine in it. Not everything has to be Will’s fear of being alone due to the
          power he possesses and how it alienates him from people, it can simply be his anxiety in leading and being involved with people, or his happiness at making his first friends in this new
          life. In thinking about this, one of the best things that Yanagino Sensei has done for Will’s character and his regrets without making it feel like an escape is the vagueness of his
          previous life. We don’t know how Will died, and we don’t know how Will lived.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Not knowing either of these two pieces really makes the feelings feel like Will’s own rather than something
          that’s been carried over from his previous life. They’re not some remainder with an experience tied to the emotion, but a feeling far more abstract and intangible. It helps sever that
          attachment to his previous life while acting as a driving force in his current one. He stumbles along and finds difficulties, and as he fails he reverts to that previous instance of
          himself, but each time Will finds it within himself to remember what he wants to achieve in this life and reaches out to take hold of the outreaching hands of his friends and family.
          Of course, really as a rule of thumb these events are still escapist in nature as rather than face the feelings head on in his previous life he has to correct them in a new one, but
          it can also be taken the other way as a reminder that you usually only have one life to live and that you should live it to the fullest. It’s a bit of a crux of the Isekai genre as to
          which way these new lives lean in terms of escapism, but I’m willing to give the Faraway Paladin the benefit of the doubt given how little importance is attached to Will’s previous
          life. At the very least it does a far greater job than any of its peers that I know of in this style of Isekai, so credit given where credit is due.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Smooth Systems</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Some of my favorite stuff out of The Faraway Paladin has been its ‘systems’. The various races and types of existences, the weapons and magic, the majority of it is really well thought
          out and executed. There is one (1) *small* gripe I have with a system though, the deities. I know they’re Western sounding names and us Westerners wouldn’t do any better for Japanese
          inspired pantheons, but Whirl is the God of Wind? Enlight the God of knowledge? Illtreat the God of War? It’s a very very very small thing, but just kind of rubs me the wrong way in a
          bit of a joking manner, largely because there’s some good names among the list of deities. Rhea Silvia, for example, or Dyrhygma or Mater, where Mater is at least a word for ‘Mother’
          rather than mother directly. It’s just something that makes me chuckle and shake my head a little, not bad or wrong by any means. What’s definitely good though is its magic system.
          The importance of words is a very interesting route to take and actually plays a bit of significance in its history. It’s not random cool sounding words put together, but is actually
          Latin, if that wasn’t obvious. Very interesting implications given the already prevalent Greek/Roman inspiration. A very simple thing to miss as the seafood and aquifers of Whitesails
          are hardly prevalent, and Latin is common for fantasy stuff in general, but there’s an undoubted connection to these words of power and the history of humanity here, that even hints
          at the potential for demigods, which *further* gives potential hints for Will *wink*. Regardless of the interesting conclusions to draw from the system itself though, Yanagino Sensei
          does a great job of conveying the importance of words via Gus early on, and can basically be summarized as  ‘A chair is a chair, but also so much more. How many ways can you describe
          a chair? How many types of chairs are there?’.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          It extends further to explain the importance of ability versus power, in the same way that someone that throws around big words doesn’t
          always know what they mean which can come back to bite them. It’s a really well thought out system that has a huge power ceiling but a very steep learning curve, a really great magic
          system to introduce from the beginning that’ll allow Will endless potential and learning. Alongside this though is some more typical systems of fantasy worlds, there’s a whole host of
          demons and monsters rampant that follow a more Western format  than Japanese, with the advent of things like Chimeras and Manticores and Wyverns. It’s well executed and traditional
          enough, but takes itself in interesting directions like we saw with the Chimera at the end of this season. Alongside that we also get traditional weapons and armor of Western Fantasy,
          though once more manages to make itself unique enough to stand independently on its own. A personal favorite was Will’s spear that can extend and produce light (the latter thanks to
          words of power engrained upon it). Will’s Demonblade, Overeater, functions in a similar way to the Dwarven-made (though Dwarves have yet to be seen) spear, it is on another level
          comparatively with its ability. It’s a great contrast to Will’s typical form of combat and is used wonderfully in episode 11. It’s great to see the purpose that all these systems have
          been imbued with, they’re not there because they need to be there, but rather *have* to be there. They play a role of significance and importance in the story but remain in the
          background, adding plenty without taking much attention away.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">An Epic Fantasy</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          At the end of the day The Faraway Paladin is another beacon of hope for more classical fantasy to make a comeback, as it builds upon the works it's inspired by while simultaneously
          removing any egregious fanservice or harmful commentary and plot. It’s the purest fantasy series we’ve seen in a while in anime format, and I’m endlessly glad to hear it’s gotten
          a second season. It’s a perfect series to build off of as it takes everything in stride and in natural fashion rather than forcing things through the regular formats and plot points.
          It’s first and most important goal is telling a story of swords and dragons, might and magic, an epic tale of the hero and his party. And at this point in time that’s not for everyone.
          Not everyone loves the immense story of Lord Of The Rings, and that’s fine. Not everyone has the patience to wait a couple of episodes for the next hint of combat. Not everyone is
          interested in a slow burn fantasy story that isn’t the easiest to self insert into. All of that is okay, I don’t need The Faraway Paladin to become the pillar of popular anime for the
          next era, I just need it to be what it is. As long as The Faraway Paladin stays strong in itself, others will be inspired and create experiences similar to it, and slowly but surely
          pure fantasy will find its niche or opening and make its way back into anime more frequently. This series isn’t meant for everyone, and I’m fine with that, media is meant to be diverse
          and unique and original so as many people can find their passions and favorites as possible. And right now, The Faraway Paladin is the tip of the iceberg in helping people find their
          favorites. Season 2 has been announced and the Light Novel makes its physical release this year. There’s plenty of hope and time for it to make an impact and change in the industry,
          and I’m looking forward to what it manages!
