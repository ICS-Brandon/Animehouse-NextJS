        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          It’s been a while since I’ve written anything on this website, and while it was partially a personal choice, life did end up getting in the way. School ended up taking up way too much of my time, and
          working two jobs at the same time didn’t make for a great match either. Between that and accelerating recovery from my shoulder surgery I couldn’t find the time and energy that I wanted to write out
          some proper reviews where I <i>wanted</i> to write them out. I could have easily forced them late at night or early in the mornings but that’s not something I’d be happy with. That being said though, I’ve
          found my stride in this new semester and the desire to write again like this so here we are!
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Is It Worth Watching?</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The Case Study of Vanitas has a few odd prerequisites to being a series that you might find worthwhile to watch. The easiest way to know is whether or not you liked the Author’s previous work, Pandora
          Hearts. If you did, you’ll enjoy Vanitas just as much, so there you go. But what if you’ve never heard of Pandora Hearts? If so, then it gets to be a bit different. If you don’t care too much about
          the critical nature of a show you’ll be in the clear. Vanitas does a lot of interesting things that don’t always follow strict rules or anything, so if you can’t put up with the flow that it curates or
          the repetitive elements that it can follow then it’s not something you’ll enjoy too much. On the other hand though, if you like those tropes of power usage or problem solving you’re in for a treat with
          this. The solutions to most of the issues are fairly standard and end in similar ways, and that adds a bit of charm to the series. However, it’s not to say that each conflict is the same, they’re all
          very unique, it’s just that the way that they finish is typically similar. Outside of the more abstract pieces of potential interest or distaste though, The Case Study of Vanitas does an incredible job
          with its world and characters. Do you like a Steampunk post-renaissance but pre Industrial Revolution Europe? References to our own history strewn about in its mythology, folklore, characters, and world?
          There’s plenty for everyone to enjoy about the show, but there’s also a handful of things that might turn some viewers off. Overall, the easiest way to understand if you’ll like it or not is within
          the very first episode. It sets in motion so many of its peculiar pieces that you’ll have a very good grasp on what exactly it’s trying to do. In my experience it’s one of the very few series with a
          make or break first episode. If you pay good attention to it you’ll know if it’s for you right away, but if you watch without your full attention it will take longer to understand if it’s what you
          wanted it to be.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Visual Prowess Without Uniqueness</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          One of the most interesting aspects of The Case Study of Vanitas for me was the visuals it gave the viewers. They were definitely high fidelity and incredibly detailed (I mean look at the first episode’s
        scene of the airship) and had so many hints as to how much detail went into the building of each piece of it. Beauty wasn’t just for the sake of beauty, but had deeper meanings and roots than what the
         surface portrays. My favorite example of this was our introduction to Dominique De Sade, as we’re greeted with a confident smirk paired with a bow that ends with flower petals strewn about akin to confetti.
         You might have thought that it was just some visual flair added to what might have simply been a plain greeting, but we find a small automaton as the source of the petals. Another amazing piece of the visuals
         is their reflection of emotion. It’s not a constant reflection but instead is used to heighten specific moments in the show, the same can be said about the use of camera angles and movements within the
         animation. The perfect example of this would be the end of Ruthven and Noe’s coffee “date”. The camera slowly zooms in from a distant angle as the scene is stained a dark crimson, similar to the color of
         Ruthven’s hair. It served as a great way to heighten the absolute command that Ruthven had in the moment and the shock and awe that Noe held towards him. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Everything in that moment was about Ruthven, and the
         red-stained scene paired with both the choreography and cinematography heightened that bone-chilling moment that commanded servitude to every desire of Ruthven.</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Everything here has seemed pretty unique so you
        might be wondering why I said that the visuals weren’t unique. I’m going to argue that the visuals themselves aren’t. Instead, it’s the characters and story that create that uniqueness. The easiest way to
        compare would be to look at the sword styles of Demon Slayer. Clearly they’re very unique thanks to the visuals that each is provided with, and in part that uniqueness is where the visual aptitude of the show
        comes from. Vanitas makes use of the same concept as Demon Slayer but it’s not its focal point. The scenes that play with the emotions of the characters are not tied to the visual capability of the series.
        It’s not a visual gimmick like some of the jokes from Nichijou, it’s not a totally unique style like Ping Pong, it’s a far more under the surface process. If the visual were an important piece, the comedic
        scenes would play out completely differently in the visual sense, but instead they take from the typical stylings of comedy in anime. The piece that adds the uniqueness is the characters. The chibi forms are
        given life and a notable difference from other comedic comparisons because of the characters. The show itself understands this and uses it to its advantage to create incredible visuals that aid in the telling
        of the story without trying to force a unique art style or animation. Some might say that it’s a bad thing but I think that instead of trying to make it visually unique, they’ve chosen to focus on the characters,
        worldbuilding, story, and overall atmosphere more than they have art style or animation which is something I certainly can’t complain about. The visuals aren’t the part of the series that will have you hooked
        or constantly raving about, instead they chose to put the heart and soul of the series in something that isn’t as easily seen.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">An Infallible Story That Borrows From History</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The easiest way to make a great story is to follow the stylings of a predecessor. If they were successful as long as you take the right steps you will be too, but how do you differentiate yourself? It’s that
          question that The Case Study of Vanitas answers expertly. We’ve got a story about Vampires, perhaps one of the largest tropes of written media and one that has been experiencing a period of renaissance in recent years.
          The interesting piece about Vanitas though is that it uses the teachings of its ancestors and histories to its advantage. It pulls historic facts and characters from our world to play out a story of their own here.
          The best example could be Jeanne, The Hellfire Witch. Both her name and nickname are taken from the famous Joan of Arc (Jeanne D’Arc in French), something that you might not even pick up on at first. Another example
          lies in Lord Ruthven, as the first recognized novel about vampires follows a vampire named ‘Ruthven’. The same goes for Louis De Sade, as King Louis XVI is beheaded in our history. Outside of characters they even
          mention all sorts of other pieces of international history. In one of the last episodes Vanitas name drops the Eiffel Tower’s creator, alongside the Tower of Babel. Even Vanitas himself is a reference, his name a
          specific style of painting that took off in the 17th Century that originated in the Netherlands (The style of painting being incredibly important to both the story and Vanitas himself). Another piece full of history
          is the malnomens that affect the Cursed Ones. All of these are fragments and concepts of folklore tales lifted from all over Europe with stories of a prison of briars, a werewolf, and even a shadow that devours all.
          While it’s not been uncommon to take from history (*cough cough* Fate) it certainly is uncommon to see it so expertly woven into an entirely different world where it’s not the history of the world.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Vanitas doesn’t
        use our history as building blocks for its story but rather makes room for each of these pieces within itself. None of them play a pivotal role like the King of Kings might, but instead are used as stepping stones in
        this story to reach the heights that the author is aiming for. Alright, so historics aside the story of Vanitas is certainly more than the sum of its parts. While the story undoubtedly has a main plot point in place
        this first part does little to actually deal with it. Instead we take our time getting acquainted with all the characters and finding out what’s going on in this world. So much happens with such little actual
        progression that the only thing that comes to mind after finishing this part is that it’s a prologue for the entirety of the story. The shocking part is that you hardly even realize how much it’s been just a setup
        until you reach the end. You think you’ll get answers about the Altus world or about Vanitas’ fateful run-in with the Vampire of the Blue Moon or something like that. But by the end there’s…. nothing. And that’s not
        a bad thing whatsoever. The show doesn’t feel convoluted or contrived, the plot points not set up purely to progress the story, the characters not acting on whims. Despite how little we’ve been given in terms of actual
        progression of the story nothing feels out of place or wrong. 12 episodes flew by without a major development for the story, and yet it feels like so much happened and moved us forward. The mystery of this progression
        lies in the incredible nature and development of the characters of The Case Study of Vanitas.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          While visuals and story and the like certainly play an important role in the quality of the series I’d argue that there are two aspects that stand head and shoulders above in terms of contribution to the show. The first being
        worldbuilding, and the second being the characters. These two pieces form the roots of this show from which the rest of the aspects grow. Without the incredible worldbuilding the historic pieces wouldn’t fit properly at all and the
        visuals would lack all sorts of incredible things, and without the incredible characters the story would feel hollow and the visuals and interactions would be for naught. With such an importance placed on the characters it’s easy
        to see why they’re so outstanding. Wildly complex and full of swagger and flair, there’s not a single character that feels without a life of their own in this series. The contradictory nature of Vanitas that allows him to throw
        himself into whatever situation he pleases, the faithfulness to his namesake. The perplexing nature of Jeanne, The Hellfire Witch that has become wrapped around the finger of a cocky human. The childlike wonder that Noe carries,
        his naivety to romance and desire, his simplistic and honest nature. Each character has so many facets to them that when paired with the world and story, the emotions of each pours forth from the screen directly into you. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">You don’t
        understand that they’re angry, you feel that they’re angry.</h4>
