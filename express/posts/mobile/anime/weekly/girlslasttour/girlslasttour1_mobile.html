        <h4 class ="brightText interjectTitle">Why do humans fight? Why do wars happen?</h4>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
        In the span of history, our species have been fighting each other at an increasingly destructive rate. We have prospered from huge jumps in technological advancements,
      but those same technologies have proven to also complement the increasing polarisation in the human race, whether that be with regards to ethnic, ideological, or economic lines. Girls' Last Tour is a show
      that greatly reflects the theme of war. It features two girls, Yuu and Chi, who go about their everyday life in a post-apocalyptic world.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Adventures of a Pragmatist and an Airhead</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the first episode, the show introduces our two main characters, Yuu and Chi, who are both parentless girls who fled from the scene of war. Leading the pair is Chi, a quiet and intelligent girl who wears
          what appears to be a British soldier’s helmet and a hooded coat. While she is small in stature, Chi is a rational person, and much more mature than her companion. This explains why she is always the one to
          drive the pair’s motorcycle, as well as the one to lead the way when they are scavenging a battlefield or factory. Interestingly, Chi is shown to be slightly acrophobic, but this fear seems to go unnoticed
          by her friend. In contrast, Yuu adorns herself with a fur coat, a Stahlhelm variant, and a rifle. She is more of a “muscle-brain” character, who lets herself be led by Chi when it comes to harder tasks such
           as food-hunting or navigation. Despite being a companion of Chi, Yuu can sometimes be a little brutish, as is shown over their dispute over the last ration, when Yuu pointed her rifle at Chi to take the food
           for herself.

        </div>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Although Yuu may seem like an unpleasant character at first, an antagonist, even, she plays an important role in the show as a companion of Chi, following and spending time with her. Yuu is also a good shooter with
        high physical prowess, making her an invaluable person to Chi, especially in tasks such as carrying rations, or lifting up rusty pieces of metal. Moreover, Yuu sometimes makes critical remarks about her environments,
        reminding the audience that, once again, it is a cold and lonely world these girls are forced to survive in. So while their relationship may not reflect how we perceive friendship — in the sense that it is supposed
        to be wholesome and sweet — Yuu and Chi are nonetheless irreplaceable to each other, whether they realize it or not.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Cold & Desolate World</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The world of Girls’ Last Tour is designed to be as empty and lifeless as possible, which is in stark contrast to the fun and cheerful tones of our two protagonists. The bridges were all torn down and rusty, the buildings
        were run-down with bullet holes, scratch marks, and other signs that a battle(s) had taken place. Armaments factories and transport planes were destroyed, and empty with a few rations or ammo as leftovers. The first episode
        takes place in winter, and the snow-covered ground was filled with weapons of all types, which I think is interesting because of the amount and variety of weaponry that was shown. The technologies of the pre-apocalyptic
        world greatly varied in era and provenance, ranging from German Stahlhelms, a Japanese Type 97, to a modern American six-barrel rotary machine gun. It’s as if the author was less focused on historical accuracy than in the
        senselessness of weapons. Nevertheless, I think that this massive array of arsenals shows just how large-scale wars can be, both in regards to the anime and in real-life. This setting is not uncommon in anime and manga, but
        what makes it so significant in Girls’ Last Tour is the way it was used to complement the characters, who are children having to survive in a cold & desolate world.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText"> Concluding remarks </h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The first episode of Girls’ Last Tour shows two girls who, despite being thrown into an abandoned world without a soul in sight, are able to survive and find joy in the little things in their everyday lives. Their daily interactions
        with their surroundings engages the audience in questioning the nature of wars, which are in many cases caused by the vested interests of small groups. The episode also left behind some cliffhangers, such as the pasts of Yuu and
        Chi, which is only partially shown in episode 1 in Chi’s dream, when she was reminiscing of her and Yuu’s past.
        </p>
        <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">So far, I think that this show has a lot of potential, what with its childish character design that is contrasted by
        the show’s deep implications about ourselves.</h4>
