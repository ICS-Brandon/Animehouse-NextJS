          In episode 4, Chito and Yuuri wanted to first test out the camera that Kanazawa had given them before splitting off. Yuuri did most of the photography, however, so the camera ended up with
          pictures of stone statues. The pair arrived at a temple-like building, which appeared to be a place of worship for the past society. There were scriptures that were interpreted by Chito as
          some kind of prophecy about a ‘paradise’ where 3 gods resided resided. But as neither Chito nor Yuuri spent much time in the old society, they did not know what the concept of
          ‘religion’ is (as for Chito, her knowledge of gods and religion seem to stem from books or other sources of knowledge). And as the one with more brain power, Chito was able to understand
          that religion mainly originated from people’s desires to have a bright future (or at least deceive themselves that there is one).

          Episode 5 begins with Chito and Yuuri driving through an industrial area, with a maze of pipelines being spread across the place. However, there are a lot of houses, and Yuuri even
          observes that there is both electricity and water. This probably means that either the place hasn't been abandoned for long, or this society has developed so far as to come up with
          means to maintain a decent supply of utilities even after civilization is destroyed. As usual, there is no trace of life, and the girls pity that such good buildings had to be
          abandoned. At dawn, they decide to take a rest in one of the houses. There, they find that only a single room has a door, which turns out to be a relatively small apartment. The room
          has a functioning kitchen, i.e. with tap water running, a ventilation system, lights, and two mini-sofas sitting across each other beside a glassless window. Exhausted, the girls
          find themselves melting on the chairs, reminiscing about their old homes. Both girls begin dreaming about what kind of house they would like should they live together in a permanent
          home. Chito wishes for a bookcase, filled with all kinds of books for Chito to enjoy in her free time. Yuuri, on the other hand, is more selfish, desiring a pantry full of food, a
          stove heater, a bathtub, and a bunk bed for both of them (even deciding to take the top compartment in this hypothetical bed).

          After waking up, the girls go on a cycle of refueling and resupply to prepare for the next trip. Despite feeling down about leaving such a comfortable place behind, Chito and Yuuri
          understand how unrealistic that would be for their food supply. So regardless of what most of us  in the current world say about wanting to travel, it is still in our nature to
          desire a solitary life. This has been the case for tens of thousands of years, and seems unlikely to change, more so when conditions force us to constantly be on the move.

          The scene then transitions to that of a suburban area, but the buildings are rather peculiar. The buildings are placed on steel columns, and seem to defy physics, at least in our
          reality. Chito is sleeping while the vehicle is on autodrive, and is woken up by Yuuri, avoiding a close crash with steel rubble. At night, the girls play a game of stacking stones,
          and Chito loses 10-0 to Yuuri, with the final game resulting in Chito losing a stick of ration to her friend. Falling asleep, Chito falls into a dream. She finds herself on a stack
          of stones (the same ones she played with Yuuri before sleep), and is approached by a gigantic Yuuri, who is even more airheaded than the real one. She messes with Chito by blowing
          her off the stones, causing her to fall into a void. Now, she meets a fish that carries her to an ocean. While admiring the scenery, a fish Yuuri appears, who consumes both Yuuri
          and the fish. This terrifies Chito, who wakes up with tears about to fall, only to find Yuuri snoring loudly next to her. It seems like this was the cause of Chito’s nightmare…
          Yuuri wakes up, finding her mouth being covered with a rock.

          The girls are on the move again when it suddenly begins to rain. Driving through the steel columns, it feels as if they are moving across a dead forest, but the trees are all
          human constructs. Incidentally, it seems like the greeneries in the city have all been destroyed, either by the war or by the past civilization. No trace of a plant could be
          seen, not even mold. It’s as if the girls are really the only living beings left in their area… Chito and Yuuri decide to stop at a rubble of concrete and steel wires,
          perhaps the remnants of a building(s). Yuuri spots a stick, and discovers that hitting a hollow object causes it to produce a certain sound. Being fascinated, she turns to
          Chito, thinking that she might also produce a sound, only to be severely hit back and kicked away, for Chito was reading and did not like to be disturbed. Yuuri decides to
          refill the water, and during this, she notices the sound of water droplets dripping onto her helmet. Curious for more, she goes back and places an array of steel and hollow
          objects where water was likely to drip from. The sounds are chaotic and unordered, but to the girls, it seems like the sounds are calming to hear. Chito explains the concept
          of ‘music’, a pre-apocalyptic idea where you arrange sounds of different pitches at certain rhythms, resulting in a harmonious set of sounds. She seems to be knowledgeable
          on this topic, as she managed to draw, albeit primitively, the same musical notations that we use. The sound of raindrops dripping gradually becomes more ordered, transitioning
          into a BGM for the new ending song of the anime.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Concluding Remarks</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          This episode was pretty remarkable, and I was most impressed by the way it demonstrated the natural origins of music. Chito’s articulate and simple explanation of the concept,
          the diagrams she drew to accompany her words, and the way Yuuri’s curiosity led her to essentially ‘invent’ music were all very interesting to see. The girls’ desire to live
          together in a single room with all of their needs and wants was also cute as well, as it highlighted just how cruel their current lives were. Chito’s dream was hilarious to
          see. I assume that all this served to move away from the rather sad and solemn atmosphere that permeated episode 4. Overall, there’s not too much excitement or dullness,
          which is expected from a post-apocalyptic slice of life anime.
