        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the last episode, the show started off by introducing its two main characters, Yuu and Chi, who are child survivors of a war-torn city. Despite being at a young age, the girls show exotic traits that would
          only appear in post-apocalyptic survivors. Chi demonstrates her intelligence through the wide array of skills at her arsenal, naturally putting her as the de facto leader of the pair. Yuu is much stronger than
          an average child, and is essentially a muscle-head of the two, which comes as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, Yuu was constantly useful for Chi, complementing her deficiencies in the physical department.
          On the other hand, Yuu’s simple-mindedness confined her from making rational decisions by herself, as shown when she threatened her companion for a piece of ration.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Snowy Start</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Episode 2 starts off with our two protagonists driving across a snow-storm on their mechanized truck. Visibility is low, their vehicle has no roof or cover whatsoever, and the only equipment the girls have on
          themselves are their soldier’s uniforms. The pair, however, did not seem like they were suffering, with Yuu even making a snowman on Chi’s helmet. Again, here we see the two peculiar girls playing at a time
          where any normal person would spend all of their concentration to navigate their vehicle. I know that this may seem like a repetitive point to make, but that’s because this will definitely be a recurring theme
          in the anime. Moving back on-track, the pair continues to drive for a while before arriving at a power plant, where they built a warm bath using a running pipeline as the water source.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Feelings of an Illiterate Girl</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After having been refreshed from the warm bath, the girls set up a fireplace (of course, most of the work was done by Yuu, who was ordered around by Chi) to warm themselves. Before sleeping, Chi pulls out her personal
          journal, which hooks Yuu, who is revealed to be illiterate. Chi goes on and on about the usefulness of being literate and how books were used to record every single thing before the war. Having lost her interest and
          concentration from Chi’s rambling, Yuu accidentally throws one of Chi’s books into the fire, thinking that it was fuel. Chi panics, and immediately throws her hands into the embers. In a world as desolate as Girls’ Last
          Tour, it would be inexcusable to destroy books, whether it be accidental or otherwise. Perhaps this says something for our world as well…
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After barely saving the book from turning into cinders, Chi sulks and goes to sleep. At this point I think the priorities of each character are more pronounced in that while both girls are obviously interested in survival,
          Chi is also an avid reader, going so far as to put her bare hands in flames to save a book. Her love for literature, when compared to Yuu’s illiteracy, may be why their division of labour was the way it is. Chi is the one
          doing the mental labour, i.e. navigating, driving, and scavenging, while Yuu would come to assist her friend with the more physical tasks. It is of note that during their (one-sided) discussion about books, Yuu mentions a
          person who both girls refer to as “Grandpa”. While nothing much can be said about it, this information may become more useful for understanding the girls’ pasts in the later episodes.
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HEXYDDtqM1gJ4d0kfsDDjYppZFkU_VBOGr7S3MiOsRB-gJCoamBbGsmG20nNew8Wuvcy-82FuNP-oiE4vbllKjdz6pwjxMde5t2Z8CbtrM-7vjQxvF7vq5ECVCnrL2z0gom_oXxX0A=w2400"/>
        </div>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The next morning, the weather calms, and both girls venture outside. Of course, Chi is still mad, despite her attempts to say otherwise. Preparing to write her morning journal, Chi finds a rough sketch of herself inside the
          notebook, with a caption below that says, “I’m sokky”. Upon discovering that Yuu had been learning to read and write for the entirety of last night, Chi cools down and the girls continue their usual day. While her efforts only
          lasted a night, Yuu’s attempt at becoming literate for the sole sake of apologizing to Chi shows that Yuu is more than just an “all brawn no brain” character. Her ability to go so far to rekindle the pair’s friendship means
          that Yuu is capable of empathizing with her more intelligent friend, whose hobbies are essentially out of Yuu’s comprehension.
        </p>

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          By this time, I was wondering when they would wash their clothes, considering that they never change despite going through all sorts of harsh weather. And coincidentally enough, with the sky clearing, Yuu and Chi go outside and
          stumble upon an open sewage, and decide to do their laundry there. Keeping with her personality, Yuu spent most of that time playing around with the sewage water, (which, if it wasn’t obvious enough, reader, is clean, since no one
          was left to use the sewage system), while Chi diligently did her laundry. However, Yuu’s silly games lead her to come across a strange creature. It had blank eyes, a body covered in fins, and a colour similar to but different than
          human skin. On bringing this up to Chi, she explained that this thing is actually a dead fish, and is also something regularly consumed by people before the war. Both girls decide to roast it before eating, the contents of which
          they find to be out-of-the-world and more delicious than the rations they usually feed themselves with. Yuu then asks her friend about the origins of this mysterious fish, to which Chi replies that it may have fallen from the
          upper “levels”, revealing a significant piece of information about the world of Girls' Last Tour.
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7eAW0Myz2s5XMchD4CVoLicqxALGViQ2__y4A10BJqr0eIr7tOsxIIQaZp63AVjmLsUytX1alFz6tniMtOxhW1pE-T8tzR41EsPGuKXbePN64G-T6nc0w-Rq74JCb5DpQlzkIHC_Qw=w2400"/>
        </div>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Concluding Remarks</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In episode 2, Yuu saw a great deal of character development, from the fact that she was illiterate to the way she apologized to Chi. Chi, likewise, revealed much about herself, especially when she demonstrated her intelligence as
          leader as well as the vast knowledge she held about the world. But the biggest takeaway of this episode, I think, is the fact that the characters of Girls' Last Tour are living in a radically different world than ours, despite wearing
          and using equipment that should’ve belonged to the XXth century in our timeline. These discrepancies show itself when it was shown that “world levels” were common knowledge, while things like books and eating fish were essentially
          considered lost knowledge.
