          In episode 2, the show revealed a significant amount of detail about Yuu’s personality (albeit in a subtle manner). Instead of the rough first impression that we got of her from the first episode, Yuu turned
          out to be a more childish girl than initially thought. As a glutton, Yuu will use everything at her disposal (most notably physical force) in order to secure a larger portion of food, even if it means
          threatening her best friend. However, this passion has also manifested itself in another form, in that she is able to strongly empathize with others in the same position, as shown when she saw Chi
          throwing herself into the fire to save a book. Another important detail in the last episode was Chi’s mention of the world’s “levels”, which gave the audience one more idea of the world of Girls'
          Last Tour.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Signs of Another?</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Episode 3 starts with Chito and Yuuri driving through an abandoned street, riddled with war-torn buildings and rubbles (Yuu’s name is known in this episode, and Chi’s unshortened name was already
          revealed in the last episode, but I thought it would be better to use the full names of the girls in a single article). Once again, the show starts us off with the girls driving on their trusty
          motor vehicle across a desolate place. Although I do find this repetitive, I have yet to be bored in the slightest (or rather, I am always fascinated by their detailed post-apocalyptic scenery).
          Chito and Yuuri spot two peculiar things on their way: a burnt cigarette, as well as footprints on the snow. Alarmed, the girls step down (naturally, with Yuuri loading her rifle), only to hear an
          explosion and the building beside them to fall right at them.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">The Traveler and His Camera</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Regaining their strength, the pair stand up to find themselves face-to-face with a tall figure, who is dressed in a coat, a visor covering their eyes, a bag, and holding a photographic machine
          (Chito, however, is knowledgeable enough to know that it's just a camera). The mysterious guest takes off his visor and introduces himself as Kanazawa, a mapper who was behind the explosion
          that almost killed Chito and Yuuri (Kanazawa later explains that he wasn’t aware of this). It turns out that according to Kanazawa, the demolition was part of his plan to build a bridge that
          would allow him to cross to another part of the city. Seeing a common interest between themselves, Yuuri and Chito form a deal with Kanazawa wherein the former would transport the latter to
          the connection tower to the upper “level”, and at the same time gaining full access to his maps for navigation.
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YzXVCkEYlG5BtWBqfZpeSlNM7zHHFpgPj3gUql5Efal0sCZyI_VzSTL_H4LwAAQiKXWXZYOvL84EOO27X6XJOAJeVObzpKPKgkxVA0zWwA7LUMWuqeO9kaPlQvSA7KekhfdCaNQZmw=w2400"/>
        </div>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Initially, Yuu was still suspicious of Kanazawa, constantly pointing her rifle his way, an act that Kanazawa himself did not seem to take offense to. It seems like the post-apocalyptic world
          has brought about new social norms to society, ones which are centered around survival. Yuu’s behaviour, however, ceases after seeing how earnestly Kanazawa is trying to clear the rubble to
          make way for the vehicle. With Chi in the lead and Kanazawa as the 3rd member, the group resumes their travel across the abandoned city.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Tales of the Ancients and the less-Ancients</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          While en route to the tower, the group stops at a refueling station to fill their gas tanks. On the one hand, Kanazawa marvels at the skills displayed by girls of such young ages doing the
          work of adults. On the other hand, Yuuri and Chito thank Kanazawa and his maps for allowing them to find the gas station in the first place. Having their fuels full, the girls (and boy now)
          arrive at the connection tower, where an elevator is located inside that would allow people to travel between the “levels”. Kanazawa explains that these towers were constructed by ancient
          humans, whose technologies were so complex that the ancestors of the current generation could not understand. Thus, in addition to populating around the connection towers, those ancestors
          also built primitive elevators (“primitive” as in relative to the sophistication of the towers) right outside the structures themselves. Kanazawa also points out the necessity to move up
          the “levels”, as resources are dwindling in the current one. Going up the unmaintained elevator outside the tower, it is revealed that Chito is no fan of heights, and whose worries Kanazawa
          deems unnecessary. In a burst of irony, one of the chains became blocked, causing the elevator to tilt, and with it fell Kanazawa’s bag of maps, whose contents he had spent years to make.
          Determined to save the files, Kanazawa jumps off the platform, but failing to grasp a single map, he falls, but is fortunately rescued by Chito and Yuuri, each grabbing one of Kanazawa’s legs.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Parting</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Devastated at losing his life’s purpose, Kanazawa becomes depressed even after the three reach the top of the tower. Looking down below, the group suddenly sees the streets lighting up, with a
          faraway location shining brightest of them all. In a scene that would normally be impossible, Yuu decides to give up a piece of ration for the depressed Kanazawa, earning his gratitude.
          Feeling better, Kanazawa says that he should part ways with Yuuri and Chito, as well as entrusting his camera to them in return for the former’s kindness.
        </p>

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Concluding Remarks</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Episode 3 expanded a lot on the world of Girls' Last Tour, as Kanazawa provided information about the “levels” of the world, as well as the technologies that he carried with him. Furthermore, with the introduction of Kanazawa, I was able to see that the character designs of Yuuri and Chito were intentional, rather than it being the artist’s art style. I find this relieving, since it would be near impossible to see Chito and Yuuri as teenage girls otherwise. Lastly, it was also surprising to see Yuuri giving up her ration to cheer up Kanazawa, which is another indication of her ability to empathize with others.
