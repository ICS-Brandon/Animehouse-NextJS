        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the last episode, Chito and Yuuri met Kanazawa, a photographer who managed to map most of the “level” he was in. This was of significant help to the girls, as they not only managed to cooperate
          with Kanazawa, but also learned of their city’s origins. The pair made a deal with Kanazawa to reach the connection tower together, which would allow them to go to the next level, where resources
          were believed to be more abundant. Along the way, tragedy occured as Kanazawa’s entire portfolio of maps fell from the tower, which devastated the poor photographer. At the end however, the girls
          managed to cheer Kanazawa up, and he paid his farewells to them in order to sketch up new maps, leaving behind his camera as a gift of appreciation for Chito and Yuuri.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">An Ancient Relic</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The episode begins with the protagonists stopping their vehicle at a certain corridor. Setting up the camera, Chito prepares to take a picture of Yuuri, who is posing beside a stone statue.
          The statue is tall, and seems to illustrate a peculiar figure with no facial characteristics save for a pair of eyes. But as the camera’s brightness was set as high, Yuuri’s picture doesn’t
          come out great, and Yuuri jokingly pokes at Chito for this. The scene flashes back to the night before, when they were given the camera. Kanazawa, who once lost his reason to live, had
          imparted an old camera for the girls to use, but had not given any instructions on how to use it. He had insisted that the child-survivors toy with it, and self-learn the functions of
          the camera, rather than being told everything. I might be overthinking, but this may be an indication about the norms of a post-apocalyptic world, that you will need to do everything yourself
          to live, rather than being told how to do it by any higher figure, i.e. parents, mentors, the government, etc…

          Having finished with trying out with the camera, the girls get in their vehicle, embarking on yet another journey. They go along a road in the city, and not much happens during this trip. Yuuri,
          perhaps getting bored or curious, decides to take out the camera to photograph the buildings. It takes her a while to toggle the settings right, and she then asks Chito to turn back to be
          photographed. Chito, wanting to satisfy her friend, turns her head back, but is distracted in doing this and crashes into a statue, causing the vehicle to be dented. Yuuri jokingly admonishes
          the driver for not being focused enough, and the girls quarrel for a short while, then continue with the drive.

          At night, Chito and Yuuri stop in a corridor for a rest. Chito takes out the camera to review the photos, to see that most of them are of the statues Yuuri have taken on the road. Looking at
          the camera screen, Chito says that there are about 52,000 photos worth of storage left, to which Yuuri responds with astonishment (recall that she is illiterate and can read neither words
          nor numbers). After messing around with the camera’s settings, Chito decides to take a timed photograph together with her friend.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Sitting down by the nearby stairs, Yuuri then takes out tonight’s rations, and distributes half of it to her companion. Tonight’s flavor is ‘cheese’, but it seems like neither girl knows what
          this ‘cheese’ is. Their curiosity is short-lived, and they each find a place to sleep. The next morning, they resume their trip on the mechanised vehicle, setting their destination as one of
          the glowing buildings that they had spotted while standing on a connection tower in Episode 3.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Hope & Religion</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Devastated at losing his life’s purpose, Kanazawa becomes depressed even after the three reach the top of the tower. Looking down below, the group suddenly sees the streets lighting up, with a
          faraway location shining brightest of them all. In a scene that would normally be impossible, Yuu decides to give up a piece of ration for the depressed Kanazawa, earning his gratitude.
          Feeling better, Kanazawa says that he should part ways with Yuuri and Chito, as well as entrusting his camera to them in return for the former’s kindness.

          After the lamp goes out, the scene switches to Yuuri, who becomes flustered and panics from the sudden lack of companionship. She touches the walls for assistance, and calls out, but there are
          no responses. At this point, Yuuri shows her vulnerable side, appearing helpless, as if a girl was just abandoned by her mother. Yuuri, despite appearing to be strong, turns out to be just
          another person who is weak when faced with the dark and loneliness. Suddenly, Chito springs up from behind with the lamp, and it turns out that Chito just wanted to prank Yuuri for her reaction.
          The room turns bright, not from the lamp, but from another source, which lights up the entire room. In front of the girls, a wondrous display becomes visible. There is a fake pond, with fake
          lotus leaves and fake fish. The pond is separated in half by a pathway that leads to statues of 3 figures. The sculptures are not like the ones seen on the streets, but show godlike figures
          supported by tall columns.

        <div style = "width:100%">

        </div>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The girls’ reactions are mixed. Yuuri declares her disappointment over the fact that ‘God’ couldn’t provide a real fish for her to eat, to which Chito warns that that comment might warrant
          ‘divine punishment’. As for Chito, despite not understanding ‘divine punishment’ and ‘God’ herself, she understands that religion was created because people wanted to turn away from reality
          and feel at ease that there is an omnipotent and omniscient ‘being’ watching over them. Here, I think that the point about religion is that it offers a kind of afterlife prosperity that
          does not exist, or at least can’t be confirmed to exist. Essentially, it acts as an escape mechanism for people in the real world who could not tolerate living with the truth, and would
          rather blind themselves with promises of arriving at a ‘paradise’ when they die. The impact of doing this is rather multi-faceted, a fact that has been demonstrated by the experiences of
          our world. But the main point here is that the people of the pre-apocalypse world in Girls' Last Tour also had a tool to maintain and deceive their sanity from the endless conflicts. But
          as society collapsed, and with no sort of system to maintain faith, religion became nothing more than a relic of the old society (otherwise Yuuri’s remark about disappointment would have
          been enough to warrant divine punishment for insolence).
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Concluding Remarks</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Episode 4 was pretty interesting, what with the girls messing around with their newly acquired camera. Chito and Yuuri also showed, as usual, a high degree of intimacy. The way Yuuri sounded
          so lonely and how playful Chito was in toying with this weakness was pretty cute, and distracts us from the reality that the girls are living in. Also, it was interesting for me to see the
          type of religion practiced by the pre-war society. Considering that there were statues everywhere the girls went, religion must have played a key role in maintaining morale in wars/crises.
          This last point is irrelevant, but the anime’s OP is starting to get into my head.
