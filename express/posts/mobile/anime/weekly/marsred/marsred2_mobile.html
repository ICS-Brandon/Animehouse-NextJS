          Episode two starts us off in Siberia with some trench warfare between the Japanese and Siberians, presumably. It's a very cold and desolate place in
          the episode and the music conveys that well. Most of the men had been wiped out aside from one left. The boy himself seems pretty smart, as he
          eats/inhales some snow from the ground to stop himself from producing steam with each breath. Only that doesn't matter when you're up against vampires.
          A man with his last breaths points out to the boy and says "behind you". When we turn back to the young man his shadow grows towards the camera
          and the silhouette of a vampire appears behind him to bite him. The scene really works well to display the military might of vampires and why they're
          being so sought after. This piece doesn't exactly illicit horror or fear per se, but more so an understanding of the abilities of vampires compared
          to humans. Overall, the episode opens with a very somber nature as it moves onto its opening.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Stellar Opening</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Mars Red opted not to use its opening in the first episode of the series, and for good reason. It contained some spoilers for vampires and the like
          so it makes sense that they didn't use it. While it makes sense I wish I had seen it earlier because it's so good. The music used is really nice and
          they use a lot of themes throughout the opening which are well-received. The opening also poses a few questions to be asked that I'll be covering in
          later parts of this review. In my opinion though, the opening for Mars Red is one of the best this season. It's very theatrical though, but Mars
          Red has committed to that nature already so it's not out of place in the slightest.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText"> What Are Vampires? </h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After the opening ends we're shown the island where Misaki was contained, and the damage she caused. Massive claw marks in the concrete, destruction
        abound and even mild flooding. The higher ranked vampires clearly are a force to be reckoned with. Once we get past the opening we're introduced to some
        already familiar faces: the two men that "died" in Siberia. They're introduced as Shutaro Kusuru, and Tokuichi Yamagami. Right away these two don't
        waste any time in giving us exposition about vampires via themselves. The information itself feels natural and flows quite easily in the conversation
        as a third vampire, Tekuchi, joins in to demonstrate the regenerative capabilities of vampires. Compared to the somber and heavy scenes
        before, this piece switches gears to be more upbeat, despite the fact that these three are essentially dead. The information dump is interrupted
        by another presumed vampire wearing a mask telling the rest to assemble, as they are meeting Maeda for the first time.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">The Limits Of Vampirism</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Vampires have a few telling characteristics to them so far in the show. One of the most telling ones is their red eyes with slitted pupils, however
        the opening contradicts this a bit. In the scenes where the vampires are meeting Maeda there's a pan onto Takeuichi the eye-patched scientist,
        and Suwa, whom we don't know much about. The curious part here with Suwa is that his eyes are not red, but his pupils are slitted. Unless I'm
        misremembering Suwa's class does not get mentioned, but Shutaro's does. Shutaro is Japan's only class A, so that means Suwa is presumably weaker
        than him, yet he does not carry the red eyes. Another telltale characteristic of a vampire is the decorated circle marked on their bodies somewhere.
        Thanks to shutaro we know that the mark doesn't appear where they've been bitten, as he doesn't have one on his neck. The next logical assumption
        is that the mark is located somewhere in relation to their specific powers or abilities, pre-vampirism. With Misaki, we saw her mark on her tongue,
        which makes sense because she was an actress. Shutaro and Tokuichi don't have their marks visible, nor do Takeuchi or Suwa which raises questions.
        <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle"> Are these markings what carries the power of vampirism? Do the markings change with the class of the vampire?</h4>

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Theater In Animation</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
        While the iteration of Mars Red that I'm reviewing is the anime, it can't help but take from its theatrical predecessor. The majority of this is felt
        through a scene where Maeda and the two fresh vampires investigate information about fake blood being pushed to vampires. This leads them to a shop
        called the 'Tenmaya', which immediately has that peculiar air to it that illicits mystery. The opening to this shop is silent as the trio meander
        in and curiously look around before being greeted by the shopkeep. In this back and forth about information regarding the false blood there are
        plenty of close ups on characters and hardly any movement between them during the conversation. A character only moves when a character has to move
        and it feels like you're watching animated theater for this back and forth. It works really well and plays perfectly into the odd air of the Tenmaya
        and the nature of its shopkeep. It's a very slow-paced conversation that begins to cover the ethics of vampirism and how vampires fit into existence.
         So many of the scenes in this visit to the shop just feel so well thought out, so well planned that the lack of movement is hardly noticeable.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Our Antagonists</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The plot of this episode has been tracking down someone killing people in a certain area. The show quickly reveals it to be vampires, obviously, but more
        so that it's a vampire couple. During this revelation the couple is shown to be using the false blood, the blood being a disputed thing with the woman.
        At the end of this first visit with the couple the woman mentions wanting to live her life like a certain play, to which the man raises some obvious
        foreshadowing by saying he was pretty sure that the couple dies in the end. After a search for the couple chaired by Maeda finds them the engage in a
        small chase which leads them to a bridge Maeda uses as a trap. Here the vampires make their last stand against Code Zero. The man is the first to lash
        out, who is quickly stopped by Shutaro. Shutaro was unable to draw his sword on the man so Suwa takes over and stabs him. Seeing her husband die the woman
        lets herself loose, managing to bite Moriyama. The scientist-type Takeuchi makes a comment that she was the more powerful of the two. Maeda however pulls
        an incredible move out of his sleeve and stuff his false hand/arm in the mouth of the vampire to stop it from biting him so he can kill it. Once she's
        dead he rushes to the side of Moriyama, who is fighting the poison/vampirism. This scene drives home the ethics of vampirism as Takeuchi sits by idly
        wondering if Moriyama will become a vampire. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle"> Maeda makes the decision for him though, and as tears roll down Moriyama's face in the rain Maeda plunges
        his knife into Moriyama.</h4>

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Another Grim Ending</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Mars Red seemingly doesn't like to end on high notes. The episode ends with the death of the upbeat and supportive Moriyama, whom I might mention was a
        newlywed. Maeda is expertly captured at the end, alongside Takuichi (the older of the two new vampires) at the side of the bridge as he's offered a light
        for his cigarette. This piece really drives home the lives that these two have lived, fighting without an end while watching everyone else around them fall.
        It's wonderful symbolism for the understanding that they share in life. In the end as Maeda walks away in the rain he says, "I should be the only one to
        become a monster.". Once he finished his sentence we're shown a bouquet of flowers at the spot where Misaki died, which were laid there earlier in the episode.
        This episode was really heavy on symbolism and meaning but it wasn't shoved down our throats so it made for a really beautiful piece that can be re watched
        several times and each time you can learn, see, or understand something more. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">It well and truly cares about its plot and characters rather than how many viewers
        it draws and how successful it might be.</h4>
