        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Is It Worth Watching?</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          For a one sentence answer, if you have the time to watch it and pay attention to it I recommend that you watch it. To go a little deeper and explain,
          the anime isn't something that can be easily viewed in the background or without at least a little bit of focus because a lot goes on visually that plays
          into the story. It's not so much that you'll miss the action, but that you'll miss the story. For those who don't know, Mars Red originally started its life
          as a theatrical play in 2015.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          With that in mind, it likes to borrow a lot of visual storytelling from its original format which is why it requires focus.
          It started as a play, and you don't watch a play to sit on your phone or message back and forth with someone on Discord. If you want the full effect
          of this anime dedicate the 20-ish minutes required to watch an episode of it. It's got vampires, it's got some action, it's got a detective noir
          vibe going. There's some lightheartedness, some heavy moments, really just a little bit of everything in there but it mostly plays as a slow
          burn detective in the first episode. <h4 class = "interjectTitle brightText">If you need something really fast paced this probably won't be your cup of tea.</h4>
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Unique Marriage Of Theater And Anime </h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Calling Mars Red purely an Anime doesn't make sense. Calling it Digital Theater doesn't make sense either. It's a very unique pairing between the two that
          flips regular anime styling on its head. It opts for a widescreen ratio that is common in more theatrical stylised content. It picks flatter colors and plays
          with lighting plenty, it shies away from the shininess and contrast-y/bright colors of modern Anime, which works perfectly with its rather grim setting and
          it's older time period. There is a certain non-linearity to the story in the first episode that plays similar to a lot of styling in plays and the more
          "theatrical" live action movies. It doesn't use out-of-place scenes often but when it does it works quite well. The main usage of this technique is the
          start of the first episode, which is the dialogue of a woman reciting a play by herself. Later we're shown the true circumstances of this dialogue and
          the meaning and understanding of the scene changes a good bit. It employs a good few theatrical strategies in the animation as well. <h4 class = "interjectTitle brightText">Rather than depict
          hyper-fast movement by stylised animation that blur the object in its motion, it opts to not animate that movement at all at times.</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          It works great for adding mystery while depicting the blistering speed of the movement from a normal person's perspective. They pick and choose these
          moments between Theatrical and Anime styling and it works really well for perspective shifting and focus. Is it something that any Anime could pull off?
          Definitely not, its history and creator are what this Anime owes its ability to merge the two unique designs so well.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText"> A Deviation From Traditional </h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the purest sense of the word this show is a deviation. It's not different, it's not that it doesn't fit its category, just that it walks the
          path less travelled in what it does. It's story has the stereotypical shounen aspects to it but it doesn't just throw you right into it. It has
          the typical plot points, the typical play by plays for a successful series, but it deviates from the norms. It doesn't throw you right at the
          stereotypical hero in the first episode, it doesn't follow the points step by step, it adds it's own uniqueness and flair to each aspect. It
          creates something that checks all the boxes you'd expect in the genre, and then decides it wants to add some more and does that. It doesn't
          necessarily go above and beyond on the shounen trope, but it tries its very best to be something fresh and new in a style where everything
          seems to follow the same rules. It's a blast of creativity in a form similar to that which you already know. And it's something you'll see
          more and more of now. Darling In The Franxx, Violet Evergarden, Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, and plenty of others. There's a paradigm shift
          in anime that's been brewing and is being shown more and more, Mars Red is one of those shows.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">An Unforgettable Introduction</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          With the pre-requisites for talking about episode 1 out of the way we're onto the real nitty gritty information now, so be warned if you haven't
          watched episode 1 there will be spoilers. We're welcomed to the world of 1920s Japan with Yoshinobu Maeda stepping out from Tokyo Station facing us.
          While he looks at the scenery we're introduced to our first supporting character, Moriyama, a member of a special forces unit in the military.
          Moriyama collects his superior Maeda and the two begin on their way to where the first episode began. The introduction of the two characters
          themselves is not the captivating aspect, but the opening credits as scenery drifts the two by while they drive to their destination of an isolated
          island which they can use to store vampires underground. <h4 class = "interjectTitle brightText">The scenery is so wonderful and the music that plays goes along with it perfectly that
          you just can't help but be drawn in.</h4>
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VPJnwG8Z1VR-XqJG-epOIoJOQRHV5d-vUi4eiCfPx2z1sZqpNAxWC9lJXdTAlodFj1Qq8PmQA2K2Pr-RIHOSauPQtJJ9795eoZhzLrnu2_to5a7BH8XUogRx6nwgQzfaUjgidsESGA=w2400"/>
        </div>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Once they reach the island Maeda is tasked with determining if the women in captivity there could possibly
          be used in Japan's vampire unit. The playfulness with the lighting in this underground piece is exceptionally well done. At one point Maeda and
          Moriyama are walking in a dimly lit hallway, and as each of the two speak the lights switch back and forth between the speaker. After his first
          meeting with the woman he is essentially left to his own work in controlling the special unit while interacting and attempting to learn from this
          vampire. At one point in this slow burn it's mentioned that Maeda has a fiancee he's engaged to but has never met, only sent mail to her.
          Throughout his few brief meetings with the woman, who's name is Misaki, there are a few scenes in which Maeda is show to be writing on paper.
          His hand writing seeming rough and relatively close to chicken scratch. This is a massive oversimplification of these moments but there's really
          so much to break down in these first few minutes.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">The Destination Is Revealed</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Through various pieces of exposition in the first few minutes of the episode, the identity of Misaki slowly comes into view. She was a popular
          actress at a theater playing Salome, of which she was very excited to show her husband when he finally returned. Her seemingly disoriented nature
          and repetition around the play was founded on the fact that she had originally died before becoming a vampire, so she was stuck in a loop of trauma.
          In one of the last scenes of Misaki and Maeda interacting she mentions how pretty his hand-writing is. An obvious nod after the fact but it isn't
          as clear cut in the moment. As the pressure builds in the episode Maeda visits the theater where she died, and is met by the actor that played
          across from her, Defrott. Maeda and Defrott pass back and forth coded and vague conversation and Defrott moves around Maeda. After their
          conversation hes leaves the theater and bumps into a woman that is eerily similar to Misaki, a young reporter named Aoi Shirase. While the two
          interact in light conversation Moriyama pulls up beside them in a car to tell Maeda that Misaki has escaped. <h4 class = "interjectTitle brightText">As the sun goes down Misaki makes
          her escape from the island, decimating the men put there to stop her.</h4>
        </p>
        <div style="width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/96sLJKgIKawcy5vL96OVbloWwb2i6nQJalIcF0TrVmtT7P0TouDfgAeuAmYfoGjDF3TgjjPOZQQXf-34_66u-P6LDGCrYW6usgPiNwaq4x3CP7htBXd2UoaCGYRR2pl4WNwdA81RnQ=w2400">

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Through what seems like a rampage she manages to not gravely injure a
          single person. With the tension in the episode fully built Misaki parades around the city at night, following the footsteps of Maeda, a
          visual dance occurring as the two travel though the same places at different moments to meet each other at the station from which Maeda first
          emerged. Here, in these final moments of the episode it's confirmed that Misaki is Maeda's fiancee. In a moment of weakness as the two meet
          Maeda attempts to pull his sword, but Misaki stops him and finally breaks free of her trauma to greet Maeda as herself whilst the sun begins
          to rise. It's at this emotional climax that the end of their story comes into view, with their first and last encounter Misaki burns to
          ashes, leaving a decorated circle etched into the ground at the station. Maeda stands motionless at the scene as the hours and people pass him by.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">A Heavy Handed Beginning</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          For the first episode of a series it's incredibly grim and full of sorrow. There is no happiness, relief, or triumph within this first piece.
          It's pure emotion emanated from Misaki and absorbed by Maeda. It's the desire for happiness and normalcy masked beneath the supernatural, and
          it sets the tone for the rest of the series excellently. This series isn't about the power of friendship always winning. It (so far) isn't
          about a singular point of evil in the world. It's not even about the drama or action. To me, it's the struggle for humanity in life and death.
          Vampires are a marred existence, something that should not be. Most of these vampires do not exist because they want to, but because they
          were unlucky enough to survive being bitten. Maeda understands that. He can grasp the torturous reality that they can live. He understands
          the loss experienced in life and wants to fight against it. He wants no one else to play the role of the monster. And this is where the
          story takes us. <h4 class = "interjectTitle brightText">A journey with a man who lives a life of loss and wishes for it to stop.</h4>
