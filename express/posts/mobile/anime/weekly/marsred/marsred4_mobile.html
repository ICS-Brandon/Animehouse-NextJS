          Episode 4 revolves around the discovery of a dead prostitute in the equivalent of a red light district. The interesting thing about this woman is that she exhibits
          some of the traits of a vampire. Sharp fangs for teeth, and red eyes are apparent on the body alongside some other features. Most notably is the strained veins/arteries
          on her face, if you remember from the second episode the young man that got bit by the vampire on the bridge showed something similar. This body could have been a
          failed attempt at vampirism, which Maeda immediately picks up on as something fishy and summons Code Zero for an investigation during the coming night. With the
           search we learn of the instinctive hierarchy of vampires thanks to Yamagami and Takeuchi. Before sending Yamagami off to find the vampire culprit he explains that
           Yamagami is being sent because lower rank vampires instinctively fear higher rank vampires, which makes him a walking radar. It allows for some funny jokes and
           situations before the episode shifts tones. Quickly we're whisked away to Aoi at a hotel she was tasked with writing an article about to find an Englishman talking
           to Okimura, the man attempting to help Nakajima with his vampire unit. After sending Okimura off the Englishman approaches Aoi and we immediately see his eyes. His
           are neither blue nor red, but green and still exhibit the slitted pupils. During his short conversation with Aoi he hands her a bottle of Ascra, making it clear he's
       the one that brought it in and is distributing it. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">The only question we're left with is for what purpose.</h4>

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Charming Moment With An Immortal</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the middle of the episode we get to spend our first decent chunk of time with Suwa as he attempts to get information from the brothel where the woman worked. Instead
        we're given a very heartwarming scene between an immortal vampire and a young woman. Despite the woman, whose name is Akesato, producing all sorts of ideas to entertain
        Suwa he simply wants to lay his head in her lap and relax. Many might think of it as an odd choice given all the options but will quickly realize Suwa is a 300 year
        old vampire that was bitten when he was around the age of a teenager. Being a vampire isn't exactly easy and finding and feeling compassion would be nearly impossible
        in those 300 years. The conversation the two have as Suwa lays in her lap is quite endearing as Suwa is honest about his origins and the woman plays back and forth with
        his repsonses. Despite some of the grimness that comes into play during the conversation from Akesato's side the overall nature is very heartwarming as we get to see
        the human side of Suwa. A 300 year old man who is trapped inside the body of a teenager. It's easy to forget his age and wisdom from looking at him but the conversation
        helps reinforce it and gives us a different perspective of the oldest vampire in Code Zero.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText"> A Vampire Invasion </h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After their failed attempt on the first night of the search Code Zero is used once again the following night to find the culprit, only to discover it's an
        entire hoard of vampires now. The key difference however is that the vampires here seem to have little to no intelligence or humanity, unlike those in Code
        Zero or Defrott and the other Englishman. Yamagami pursues these pseudo-vampires to wherever they were going, attempting but comically failing to contact
        the rest of Code Zero. Cornered, Yamagami begins to try and fight the hoard of vampires himself while calling out to Shutaro, who thankfully hears him and
        makes his way to Yamagami. Shutaro ends up making it just in time as Yamagami is being feasted on. Despite his pacifism in the earlier episodes Shutaro finds
        it in himself to kill the vampires feeding on his friend, and does so in an impressive manner. After Yamagami is saved we switch to Suwa who is in an alleyway
        watching a small group of vampires feast on a body. Sensing Suwa they attempt to run away but are brutally sliced apart. As the bodies fall we recognize
        the woman on the ground as Akesato. The two share a bittersweet moment before her death as Takeuchi appears behind Suwa. In the last moments with her Suwa
        asks Takeuchi to teach him some songs, a reference to the requests made by Akesato. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle"> The episode gives us a saddening ending to the short-lived existence of Akesato
        and an everlasting mark left on Suwa.</h4>

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Veiled Threats And Power Struggles</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the end Shutaro and the rest of Code Zero end up stopping the vampire's rage in the red light district while at the same time finding the source of the Ascra,
        essentially putting an end to its mass distribution, for the time being. Thanks to Yamagami's keen nose he recognizes the scent from the barrels that Ascra was
        stored in saying that is smells like Scotch. Right away Maeda pieces it together as an Englishman that's bringing the Ascra in, casting all doubt aside that it
        could be anyone but Rufus from the viewer's perspective. After giving his explanation of the potential sources Maeda suddenly faints, and the episode ends. In
        between the pieces of Code Zero discovering the source of the Ascra , Defrott appears beside Rufus on a rooftop in the red light district discussing the topic of
        the Ascra. This conversation means two things, the first being that Defrott was aware of the person that would be distributing Ascra but didn't know that Rufus was
        currently distributing it. The second is that Defrott ranks somewhere above Rufus in terms of Vampires, but also that Rufus serves higher ranked vampires as well.
        This episode took a massive step forward in the conflict of the Ascra peddlers and Code Zero while also producing some interesting relationships between characters.
        The human side of Suwa was a really nice touch to see and helped to ground the episode and keep it close to its roots as it edged closer to typical action territory.
        <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Overall a very entertaining watch that was able to give us plenty of information in such a short period of time while also showing us some proper action.</h4>
