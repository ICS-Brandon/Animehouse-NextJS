        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          At the start of episode 3 Emilyko meets Mia in the hall on the next day, wary of what had happened the day before. Mia however acts completely
          differently and is back to her high-energy self. She explains to Emilyko one of the other purposes of the living dolls, to serve as the faces of
          Shadow family members. Since Shadows don't have visible facial expressions which makes it hard to convey emotion, their living dolls mimic their
          movements and emotions (and to a T, might I add) so that their intent can be expressed. This use makes a lot of sense considering the standing
          of the Shadow family and their perceived importance. Of note as well, if your eyes were sharp in the last episode or have already watched episode 3,
          when a living doll is acting as a Shadow's face they wear lace on their exposed skin aside from their face. The logic for this was so that all of
          the focus is on their face rather than any other part of them.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          This little bit of information that's quickly forgotten is a really nice touch to
          the concept of being a Shadow's face, and to a degree further drives home the fact that living dolls are purely to be used. After the explanation
          Mia and Emilyko head off to clean more of the house and meet up with Rose and Lou. The group makes their way to the cleaning hall to pick up their
          equipment, and we get a brief look at some cleaning supplies that definitely don't look like they should be used for cleaning, namely the bludgeoning
          tools like maces that are hanging on the wall ever so casually next to the brooms and mops. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">It feels like with each episode the line between the
          uppity nature expressed by our main characters and the grim underlying nature of Shadow House blur more and more.</h4>
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">The Life Of Dolls</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After seeing the murder hardware in the cleaning room we continue on a doll tour of Shadow house. We get shown things like a classroom where the
        dolls will learn, we get to learn about places like the kitchen and laundry facilities and all of that. In the classroom that they visit the lace
        that Mia was wearing is pointed out by Emilyko and explained by Rose. When a doll is serving as a Shadow's face their called a 'Portrait' and they
        wear the lace to take the attention away from all other skin aside from their face so that they can best serve their Shadow. Overall this tour around
        the house is very light hearted and happy, as is par for the course in the series so far, but being 3 episodes in now the pseudo-dystopian nature of
        their conversations catches on pretty quickly and produces an odd air to their dialogue, making it just ever so slightly uncomfortable. While on their
        tour the group comes across the debut hall, where Rose explains what the debut is for. Essentially, it's a coming of age ritual in Shadows House
        wherein a Shadow and their Living Doll complete some sort of challenge to decided whether or not the duo is an asset to the family, if they pass their
        Living Doll becomes their face and they are seen as adults.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          When Emilyko tries to ask more questions about the debut she's refused answers by Rose and
          Mia and they continue down the hallway they were walking. As Emilyko asks more questions tension grows in the conversation as Mia's tone changes in
          answering Emilyko as she begins to parrot back the Doll propaganda such as "We live to serve the Shadow family", and all of that. The air grows incredibly
          grim and dark very quickly as Mia controls the conversation, taking it out of Rose's hands. During this part there are a few close ups on Mia's mouth
          when she is talking which makes the scenes even more uncomfortable. During this heavy talk Emilyko mentions the words "Lord Grandfather" in which Rose
          quickly covers Emilyko's mouth and tells her to never say those words again as they're reserved for Shadows only. The look of fear on her face shows
          she's knows what will happen if a doll is caught saying them. Between Rose and Mia there is a lot going on behind the scenes that we haven't seen yet.
          <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Rose is quiet and secretive, almost living in fear of the information while Mia is borderline brainwashed in her fervor for reiterating all of the
          propaganda given to the dolls.</h4>

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">An Ugly Existence Pokes It Head Out</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          While the group was talking an alarm gets rung, summoning all the dolls to a specific area. Upon their arrival we are met with the first piece of
          explicit horror in the series so far, a phantom. A phantom is the manifestation of uncleaned soot that becomes a sort of monster, like the bug that Kate
          squashed in her room. Phantoms are quite dangerous because soot is explained to have ill-intent, or in other words is imbued with negative emotions.
          The explanation makes quite a bit of sense as soot is generally emitted in large quantities when the Shadow is feeling negative emotions. Oddly enough
          the Living Dolls tackle the phantom relatively casually, so while it might be a rare occurrence it's not something overly uncommon for the dolls to face
          off against. The phantom is a tough monster however, and when it's hit it gets split into smaller pieces. One of these pieces gets away which Emilyko
          and co. chase after. Emilyko and Mia are the first to get there and accurately deduce that it's behind a painting on the wall so they move to corner it.
          What they didn't account for though was a second monster in the room hiding behind them. With their backs to the second one it jumps out at Emilyko but
          Rose makes it just in time to push her out of the way. These following scenes gave me goosebumps and could only remind me of Madoka Magica.

        </div>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The soot
          monster latches onto Rose's head and begins to suffocate her, some of the soot making its way into her mouth. While everyone stands by in horror the second
          monster comes out from the painting and joins with it to completely encompass Rose's head causing her to collapse to the ground. Soon after the soot
          monster takes the form of a spider, long spindly legs of soot pouring out from Rose's head. The art and design changing and becoming more noisy, a haze
          of red being mixed with the soot to display its evil intentions. The spider quickly pulls Rose upright and makes a b-line for the nearest corner, which
          it climbs up and attempts to hang Rose to death from. With some quick thinking from Emilyko, she remembered that soot doesn't do well with water and poured
          a vase over Rose's head to save her. While it got rid of the monster Rose comes back to us acting like a zombie, her eyes completely empty. As if on cue
          another squad of dolls comes in to take Rose away and heal her. This entire scene was so wildly horrifying it was impressive. It also drives home how
         absolutely terrifying soot is. The entirety of the existence of living dolls is in the balance of their cleaning, if they don't clean enough they will die.
          What an utterly terrifying revelation.

          After that horrifying experience Emilkyo, Mia, and Lou head for the baths to clean themselves up. Upon arrival they have to split up as only 2 can go in
        the bath at a time, so Mia sticks with Emilyko since it's her first time. The atmosphere in the bath is so incredibly light-hearted that it feels like the
        near-successful murder attempt on Rose never happened, despite the fact that they talk about in while in the bath. The cute relationship that exists between
        Mia and Emilyko melts away all memories of the soot monster encounter, until you see the scars on Mia's back. The first thought is that the scars are from her
        Shadow master, which would make sense. The next logical jump someone would take is that they're punishment for something, personally I'd believe that punishment
        to have something to do with Mia's fervent nature in reminding Emilyko about the purpose of the dolls, but we'll find out more later. Once the duo is finished
        their baths they come out to find Rose waiting for them, as if nothing happened. While the reunion screams happiness and is very light hearted all that were
        left were questions for me. Mia makes a bet about what Rose will do upon return, and hits the nail on the head. She even had her movements down to a T.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          This
          part set off the alarm in my head heavily, I don't believe that Mia knows Rose so well that she would exactly predict every little detail in Rose's return.
          Instead, I think Rose is incredibly predictable in nature because of how she was created. In the bath Mia talks about living dolls being "finely crafted",
          with this in mind I don't believe that Rose was actually healed but recreated. If a doll is made and can be made with varying degrees of intelligence and
          personality I think it more logical that they disposed of the old Rose and created a new on in its place. Of course I could be wrong but I doubt Rose came
          out alright considering how grim the show can be at times. The main reason for believing this is because the show punches in close on Rose as she begins
          her movements and response, which makes it that bit more uncomfortable.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The ending minutes of the episode gives us more information and curiosity to digest alongside Kate and Emilyko. Upon her return to Kate, Emilyko tells her
          of the encounter of the Phantom and the rest of the information she learned. Kate had never heard of a phantom before, meaning that potentially the existence
          of these soot monsters is something the Shadow family doesn't know of. Digesting the information Kate reminds Emilyko to put things back where they were
           after cleaning, the object that was moved is shown to be Kate's doll. When Kate tells Emilyko this Emilyko lights up as she happily asks if Kate's doll is
           "alive" like Emilyko's. Kate disregards the comment as something silly from Emilyko trying to excuse her mistake. As Emilyko continues Kate gets more upset
           and frustrated, which sends Emilyko's doll flying into the air. Kate expresses that it's the Lord Grandfather's power that breathes life into the Living Dolls,
           so Emilyko responds saying that Kate might have similar powers. Surely enough Kate can make Emilyko's doll move without touching it. Excitedly Emilyko tells
            Kate that it's because she can control soot, as her doll is stuffed with soot. After this interaction we're shown Emilyko in her room writing out all of
            the information she learnt today when she's called by Kate, who is shown pouring soot on command into a glass on her table, something that isn't documented
            anywhere in Shadow family history.<h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle"> Is this odd power an extension of the previous which the Lord Grandfather wields? Or is it something different entirely?  </h4>

          This episode leaves us with many possible routes into the fourth episode, none of which will give a clear answer to what is giving on but have the ability to
        lead us closer. Despite it's shortness so much information was thrown at viewers, but not all of it was handed out. Things like Rosemary's existence and Mia's
        Shadow master remain shrouded in doubt and mystery, but the soot monsters and the power of soot itself become a little clearer to us, Emilyko, and Kate. While
        it was most definitely an information dump it didn't feel wrong or forced thanks to the blank slate that Emilyko and Kate are. Emilyko knows nearly nothing of
        Shadow House and Kate's knowledge is restricted. This works perfectly as Emilyko is how we learn of mostly everything in the show, and Kate fills the gaps in for
        undersatnding. The writing here in these two characters is excellently done and doesn't feel out of place at all and allows the flow of information to be organic
        in places where it otherwise couldn't. However, despite the show's willingness to give us information you know at the same time it's hiding a massive wealth of
        it, so when will we learn of it? Will we even learn of everything, like where the existence of phantoms comes from, or if someone can control them?
