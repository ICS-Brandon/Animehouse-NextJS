          Well, it took Monday a bit to get into shape, but the two shows I was waiting for started this week! Sabikui Bisco is the one I was far more interested in, but Tribe Nine didn't
          really disappoint either. It was way crazier than I was expecting, and certainly has a strong sense of style. The character designs are pretty "normal" but have a few pretty defining
          traits, like physics-defying hair. Tribe Nine really knew what it wanted to do when it was talking about Extreme Baseball, and showed up with an episode that makes it impossible to dispute
          that it's got a unique idea and execution. It's pretty cliche with some aspects, but is crazy enough that it doesn't matter. Also has some really enjoyable ideas, like a pair of budding
          protagonists taking in under the old guard rather than just one, and that the powerhouse character doesn't hold back until the end. We actually get to see Kamiya (leader of the Minato tribe)
          destroy a tower with a baseball during a game. If that's not over the top I don't know what is. Point being, it's a really cool series that might just make Monday's bearable.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The other show that's started airing on Mondays is Sabikui Bisco, and has it ever felt like I've been waiting a long time for it. The first teaser trailer came out a few months shy of a year,
          but since watching it in March of last year I've had a hard time forgetting about it. Thankfully it's first episode didn't disappoint as it perfectly embodid that chaotic and borderline insane
          nature that it's teaser trailer exhibited. Non-linear storytelling on top of one of the craziest concepts to actually have solid execution in modern memory, it's pure eye candy for people looking
          for something that's out there. I mean, there's massive mushrooms sprouting from arrows shot from a boy's bow, and a special forces team that wears bunny helmets. If that wasn't enough, there's massive
          names in the voice acting, which includes: Tanjiro's VA Natsuki Hanae, Kenjiro Tsuda, Ishigami Yu's VA Ryouta Suzuki, Reina Kondo (Riko in Made In Abyss), and even more. It's got a lot behind it and some
          incredible potential, so if there was anything new for people to watch this season, it's this.

          Going to keep this short for Orient. It's still pretty alright? I guess? It's got some cool concepts but it feels like the anime is just holding out for each of the cool pieces and just sort of limps along in between,
          which is a bummer given it's from the creator of Magi. I've heard conflicting reports about the manga, so I'm planning on checking it out at some point. Does that mean Orient isn't worth checking out at all? Depends on what
          you're feeling. If you've got a few extra minutes and nothing better to do, it's not a half bad to waste some time. If you have anything else though I'd recommend just passing over it, feels like something that might be better
          as a binged series rather than weekly.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Next is Police In A Pod, and despite how much I say it's like Uramichi Oniisan, I still got caught offguard with its second episode. It's able to take all the mature jokes made and meld it together with a darker and more serious
          conversation about sexual assault and abuse, which comes from the perspective of women largely which is great to see. It delves into their thoughts on the matter and does so in a really solid way. There's some more tense and serious
          aspects to it, but then there's also just sort of side comments about people feeling uncomfortable in a male-dominated workplace and that it makes them feel bad that they feel that way. They also end it on a positive note with the male
          coworkers in question supporting the women in a pretty natural way. Overall it's a really balanced conversation on the topic that doesn't pull any punches, but also doesn't take itself too seriously. Still plenty of 18+ jokes and skits to
          lighten the mood, so overall a pretty enjoyable watch.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          I was really hopeful about Tokyo 24th Ward with its first episode, but this second one makes me doubt it. There's a lot going on, a lot of flashbacks and a lot of talking about stuff that isn't always perfectly clear. If it had stronger direction
          in this confusion it might make more sense, but it was just a bunch of non-linear jump cuts between flashbacks and characters that you might not have seen yet. You know who some of the characters are, but their importance and value to the series
          just isn't communicated to the viewer, so a person that you think might be of importance in one way ends up being important in a completely different area, or not at all. At its core it's still solid with RGB, but it's exterior is very shaky here.
          I'm really hoping that it's just a fluke and they were rushing to get exposition out the door for things, but given the issues raised in producing Tokyo 24th Ward, the benefit of the doubt probably isn't a great thing to give.

          Ousama Ranking is really on track to be a truly top-tier show that's underrepresented in talks for high quality series. The depth of its story and characters is really impressive, and it manages such a dynamic feel to its world that's especially apparent in its
          latest episode. On top of that, the complexities of the story are really quite an enjoyable aspect. It doesn't rush itself and takes time and care in setting up each part of the plot so it moves smoothly and effortlessly along itself. Plus, WIT just does such an incredible
          job with animating it. Some really high quality stuff, and even despite the more childish art style doesn't have any issues with blood or gore. There's not really too much I can say in terms of praise without repeating myself, but it's a very enjoyable series. Always several things
          going on at once and always something to pick up on and/or pick apart, especially with Ouken recently. Ouken's character is a really curious existence that almost in a way parallels Bojji (as is hinted at by Despa), but has some really interesting darker characterstics and abilities
          that haven't been entirely revealed yet.

          Platinum End is one of those series that just seems to either completely connect with someone or entirely miss, and for me it's completely connected. It's hard to really put into words the allure of the show to people that haven't watched or don't have the interest, but it's this wonderfully
          awful commentary on the human condition that depicts us at our lowest and worst. Even a man such as Mukaido having reached that point. His power and ability going to his head despite all he said, even going to the lengths to call himself a Hero of God in front of his family. But regardless of
          the wrongs he's committed, you sympathize and feel his pain, and in that way is the oppsosite of Kanade. Humanity is really both an awful and wonderful thing, and they've done a terrifyingly accurate job depicting that here, especially in this episode. Really, this episode goes into my books
          as one the greats for a very small reason. It's left me largely speechless from an emotional perspective. The words that I might bring forth from myself can't even begin to compare to what I truly think and feel, it leaves me at a point where writing or attempting to explain it feels wasteful.
          I'm pretty sure I said something similar in last week in regards to Platinum End, but if you ever find the desire or whim to watch, episodes 13 and 14 are some of the best I can recommend for the series.

          My heart belongs to one show, and only one show on Fridays. The Case Study of Vanitas. I fell in love with it 2 seasons ago now, and this first episode immediately rekindled that
          feeling. Just endless excitement at how things were handled, it well and truly felt like a movie with how cinematic it was. Though the cinematography was most likely to accommadate
          the massive Beast of Gevaudan. Regardless of that though, everything felt so perfectly executed, and the characters were absolutely outstanding as per usual. Just a wonderful world
          to experience, and the new Chasseur Astolfo was a great addition that was used incredibly well. As a side note, Astolfo is a Paladin in Matter of France, alongside Roland and Olivier! Also!
          The Beast of Gevaudan is actually a real myth/tale from that era of France that's shown in the episode, which gives some hints for what the malnomen may be. Mochizuki has really done an
          amazing job of melding history and prior fiction into a wonderfully coherent and somehow unique experience. Definitely recommend checking it out, and as a bonus all the characters are over
          the age of 18 so it doesn't feel awkward when things get steamy.

          It's not really any surprise that My Dress-Up Darling is the juggernaut of new anime this season, I understand why, but it doesn't mean I'm any less disapointed in it. I won't pretend that
          fan-service isn't deeply embedded in almost all forms of anime, and I have even said that some of it in this show specifically wasn't that bad as it was a bit more "tasteful" and at the very
          least unique in its exposure. That went out the window in its second episode though. Almost an entire episode centered around Marin in a bikini as Gojou gets up close and personal, and we're
          bombarded with an incredible amount of unnecessary scenes and close ups. If there wasn't much going on I wouldn't be as upset as I am, but they have a great dynamic and they blew it on fan-service.
          Gojou being awkward was nice, and Marin feeling similarly was too, but they took it too far. They made Gojou's neverousness far too comical and it just takes you out of that mellow dynamic and relationship
          that the two already have. I enjoy this show *because* of that dynamic, so to see it so hastily placed aside so that breasts can fill it just makes me feel disappointed.

          Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really just exactly what I need after a long week, especially this one. I was travelling home all day Friday from being on vacation, and no matter how much you prepare it just sucks
          all the energy out of you. I didn't want or need anything super deep or intense for watching on Saturday as I relaxed, so Akebi fit the bill perfectly. I loved watching Akebi make her friends and joke around
          and get herself into some funny situations. If you looked at Akebi at a glance you might have thought it was just emobdying the "perfect" life, but it has its bumps here and there. They're not bad by any means
          but it makes an extra effort to make sure everything's satisfying and heartwarming without being perfectly picturesque, and in that way that's what makes it so enjoyable. It feels fleeting and in the moment, with things
          like Akebi's late night conversation with her dad about her first day before he has to leave early the next morning. Plus, it just has some absolutely beautiful visuals, I really can't get enough. Cloverworks does a
          great job melding the foreground content with the incredibly high quality backgrounds, and cranks everything up to 11 for some wonderful stills here and there. Akebi does a wonderful job of blocking out everything happening
          in your life and just allowing you to enjoy itself.

          So, after revisiting the first episode of Requiem Of The Rose King I think it's safe to say that a lot of things are creative decisions with it. The darker colors on average being used to parallel Richard's feelings and emotions,
          and similar things being done with the weather. This second episode in particular though felt far more dramatic than the first, and had some really great performances in it. The Voice Actors really made it feel like they were
          acting on a stage with how much they projected the emotion of their characters, and it makes it really unique. The only grip I had with it was that it's middle felt very disconnected and hard to follow for about a minute and a half.
          Once they made it out the other side though it was pretty straightforward. The only challenge with a theatrical-esque performance in an anime format is that it's hard to really keep it the same as you're not afforded the same leeway
          of separation in scenes as you are in theater. To fix that though, all they'd need is a narrator in my opinion, and if they did have one it'd fit in just fine given the theatrical roots. Overall pretty solid, and had some interseting notes
          but could have been a bit better in terms of storyboarding.

          So, I wouldn't say I'm a BL aficionado, but Sasaki and Miyano is very quickly topping my charts for the stuff. Really well executed concept that holds onto its roots but doesn't let them become entrapping. It's willing to reach out into different
          areas and ideas and find a way to make them work, and it makes for a really good time. It also helps that there's such a great dynamic between the pair already, that doesn't just hang in the balance of a few choice encounters for stuff. They hang out
          and do normal things and have a good time, and Sasaki's comedic timing is just absolutey impeccable with this episode. There's not an abundance of jokes per se, but more so a lot of funny moments that you might expect from high school boys. Speaking of that,
          either I missed it in the episode previous or they've just now confirmed that it's an all boys school. Interesting idea that helps drive home the BL aspect in potentially a more accepting manner, though overall I'd say even without that they've done a great job
          of making it more accessible and enjoyable to all viewers. Easily a win in my book to get more diverse series and characters, and always a plus to have it done so well and be so enjoyble. A genuinely enjoyable budding romance between the pair that isn't just Boys
          Love.

          With this second week underway, it's really nice to see all the gaps get filled in both in terms of days that stuff airs on and genres. There's a healthy helping of all sorts of stuff, and even somehow two (2) series that follow a smart person in control of a country
          as a slice of life political series. Not any big names by any means but it feels like that's given me more a chance to check out some different things, like Sasaki and Miyano, for example. There's not as many heavy hitters that demand your attention so you're more free
          to shop around and see what else tickles your fancy. And who knows, maybe some of those lesser known shows will be some of your favorites for the season! We're still picking up steam with the season but it definitely feels like a lot of the series this time around have given
          some really strong first impressions, though some have been betrayed. Watching all the fun series of this season so far doesn't feel too overwhelming or taxing, but it definitely feels like comedies dominate a lot of the more lesser known ones and personally speaking I find
          comedy one of the easiest genres to follow. Overall though, lots of enjoyable stuff going on in this second week and we're still just getting started!
