          Godzilla Singular Point tackles an area that's just been coming into popularity in the last while. Shows like 'Science Fell In Love So I Tried To Prove It',
          and 'Dr. Stone' have been popular as of late mostly becuase of their excellent mix of a genre with science. Godzilla Singular Point does the same thing,
          so if you don't like a slower pace with more science and theory. However, if you love to theorize and think out loud with the cast like a total nerd
          you'll love this show immediately. It's blend of science and science-fiction is so interesting and so much of its theory is rooted in reality
          that you can't help but think it all makes sense at times. And it has Godzilla and those monsters in it so of course it's gonna be off the charts
          cool at times, just not right away.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Blend Of Old And New</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Right away the first thing that struck me about Godzilla Singular Point (aside from the stellar opening) was it's art style.
          The first thought I had was that it reminded me of older animation like Neon Gensis Evangelion. The line art, coloring, and everything
          else just felt so similar and was so well executed. It's not to say that Godzilla SP is stuck in the past, it's character designs are much
          more modern and unique and it uses all sorts of modern conventions for animation and the like. Godzilla SP simply knows that it's an older
          story to tell so it pulls some old in with the new to make something really interesting. Godzilla SP is essentially re-creating anime of old
          with a modern twist on it in terms of art. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Everything feels like it could be right at home with some of the older
           popular anime yet it is being run in the era of shows like Violet Evergarden and that's why I love it so much.</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          It's not afraid of deviation and a lack of fidelity. Can a show
          have heart without unique art? Absolutely, but does art play a critical role in its story? Most defintiely. Godzilla SP makes use of its old art
          and new story perfectly to pay homage to the past while giving viewers something new.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Disconnection Between Main Characters</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Something that I've found unique to Godzilla Singular point is the fact that it's main characters aren't in a singular group. It opts for two
          groupings in its main cast, those that work at Otaki factory (Yun, Haberu, and Goro), and the university student Mei. The separation feels natural
          and makes sense as their existences are two separate sides as shown in the story. Yun is a hyper-intelligent person with a focus on technology, whereas
          Mei is a theoretical biology student at university. The decision to separate these two groups was wise, though their paths intertwine quite frequently.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Having the separation lets there be two sides to the story that unfolds which works perfectly as each has a different perspective to offer and allows
          the story to pursue multiple avenues at once. It also makes communication between the two parties interesting when it occurs. Having the separation and
          essentially following two separate stories lets the plot broaden much more than if it were just a single gruop being followed. It can at times make the
          introductory episode a little odd at moments but it allows for so much more information to be given to the viewers, which is basically a must in this series
          with how much ground it covers.
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dgFmKfnNX0-ChmN1exTU_3kLw0H16oQa0zEMVs-Lpq8eudId75kXgcDZGk9vUkb46geq7-hLte6ZNWlq_xDSq-znhK8T_PLRwMnZ9b-q0bZeV_eh-AekE_SwPuNetwnW1ZvlBFzphg=w2400"/>
        </div>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Understanding The Theory</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Godzilla Singular Point doesn't shy away from its use of big words and terminology from the get go as Yun and Haberu are sent to find the source of an
          odd radio single being played from within an abandoned house. From here Yun immediately bombards us with scientific information and knowledge on the
          mansion, and once the source is discovered effectively explains how it works. This theory and the use of radio waves plays a large role in this episode
          as its how it sets up the meeting of the two groups, although it does fall through due to some *ahem* incidents. The episode walks viewers through the wonders
          of science without an ounce of action, but had me captivated the entire time. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Their understanding and ability to make sense of
          the theory, math, science, etc. that they talk about makes it so enjoyable to watch as a viewer. </h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          If you've watched Dr. Stone it's understanding of the theory that it talks about is essentially on par with
          the quality that it's talked about in that series. For a nerd like me it's super satisfying to have so much science and theory to nerd out with and learn about as I watch.
          It makes it feel like the episode is far more interactive than a usual episode might be. I'm writing this portion after I've already seen a few of the episodes so let me
          just say that if you like the realm of science and theory even the slightest bit is this show a treat, it delves so deep and so far into it that it's prevalent in every
          part of the episode and that's what makes it great. While it's most definitely a story about Godzilla, hence the name, the show has no fear to deviate from course and
          all sorts of information, plot, and exposition to make this rendition of Godzilla as unique as it can be.
        </p>

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Blink And You Might Miss It</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          You're probably reading this right now and thinking, "Wow, already over?", and you're correct. This review has been relatively short becuase it either had to be short
          or be a small paper on the theory introduced in Godzilla SP, how its used, how our characters are used as mediums to better understand this theory, and why the theory
          even matters to begin with. As you can tell I've opted for the short on this episode because it's the first one. I don't want to spoil all the fun for those that will watch.
          And there is plenty of fun to go around in this series. Godzilla Singular Point, while most definitely slower paced than most Godzilla series, does something the others doesn't.
          The fact that they've deviated and opted for such a unique spin on the tale as old as time makes it that much more interesting to watch. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">
          You're not <i>just</i> watching a Godzilla show.</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          You're watching a show that deals in heavy theory and science and how it relates to the impending threat. You're watching a show with implicit time-travel, history and confusion,
          with a thirst for scientific understanding. And of course, you're watching a show with Godzilla and a bunch of other monsters in it so it's bound to be cool. If you're on the fence
          after reading this or even watching the first episode I really recommend sticking around for at least the second episode as the mystery of the nature of the show adds a whole new level to it.
