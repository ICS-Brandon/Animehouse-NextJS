          Episode 6 starts by showing us a massive flock of Rodan invading Manhattan, droves upon droves heading straight for anything with radio waves. It's an incredibly harrowing sight, considering
          how calm some are amidst the invasion of kaiju. While it's highly distracting for its visuals these opening scenes give us some all important information. The kaiju are spreading. At this very
          moment we have no idea of how they're spreading, it could be as simple as migration or a new entry point somewhere off the coast of the United States that operates similarly to whatever is
          spitting out the Rodan in Japan. With that concept aside we move to an even more peculiar one, Jellyfish. Yes, I said Jellyfish, and some of you might already be on the right train of thought
          with just that one word. Satou is flipping through the history of Ashihara at Misakioku with his boss Yamamoto, who offers eerie comments about the all forgotten theory architect. The dialogue
          goes along the lines of saying that Ashihara was researching a red tide that landed on the coast 80 years ago when he found the jellyfish. This expose piece ends as suddenly as it began, leaving
           an air of curiosity to it, which can be hard to decode so I'll break it down here.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          There's a few other things that have produced a red tide off the coast in recent memory in the show, the Rodan
          and other kaiju. With that in mind and Ashihara's interest in the archetype particle it's safe to say these jellyfish have something in common with archetype. Going even further, while at the
          same time rewinding to my earlier comment, there's something special about these jellyfish clearly. At the bare minimum I'd believe them to be some species of jellyfish inspired by the "immortal
          jellyfish", Turritopsis dohrnii. In our reality this jellyfish cannot die of old age, it's biologically impossible. Instead of living "forever" and not aging this jellyfish reverts itself to an
          immature state and redevelops from there, sorta like a biological time travel, raise any eyebrows? With knowing that and hearing about the red tide 80 years ago and seeing the red tides now it's
          safe to believe for the moment that the jellyfish's  immortality is thanks to some sort of relationship with archetype. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Also, to add a bit more credibility to this theory they make a comment on
          Ashihara being well over 100 years old at this point... if he was still alive.</h4>

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Existentialism, Philosophy, And Science Rolled Into One</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After hearing about Ashihara and his fascination with the red tide and jellyfish we follow Mei as she goes searching for pieces of Ashihara's research so she can better understand archetype.
          Despite finding a good bit of it she's unable to make heads or tails of what she's looking at. It's only when Mei's sat down at a table in the library she was in that sense is able to be made
          of what looks like scribbles. Mei isn't the one that decodes it entirely though, the woman seen in the previous episodes, Ms. Kanako (foreign affairs, we find out), is the one that gives Mei
          the initial push. Ashihara's notes intertwine music and philosophy and poetry with his complex math and science, and it just so happens Kanako recognizes the references. The pair are two sides
          of the same coin as Kanako unravels the complex wordplay for Mei and poses the correct questions to help her dive deeper. We get to experience an interesting conversation where existentialism,
          religion, and philosophy playfully flirt with concrete theory, math, and sciences. While the two engage in their conversation Mei aimlessly doodles on a page as she recalls Kanako's comment about
          fearful symmetry and realizes what's happening. In classic nerd fashion Mei gets excited about her breakthrough and rushes away, forgetting her books and belongings momentarily. Making a break
          for Professor Li Mei begins to explain Ashihara's Cascade, and does so in a familiar fashion to some. She takes a single strip of paper, a 6 written on one end and a 9 on the other, and in folding
          the paper they both become the same number with one over top of the other, the once rectangular strip now taking the shape of a triangle. In the closest approximation what's going on here is Mei
          is proving how time is warped and bent around the object to produce the effects of time travel. My personal favorite of this example is taking a piece of paper, folding it in half and poking a hole
          in it. The paper represents our 3 dimensional space and time flowing from left to right, folding it being a literal fold in time which produces what seems like time travel. It's essentially the
          reverse explanation of the 6 = 9 paper. Some very awesome stuff to cover for sure, though difficult to understand given the complex terminology that Mei uses.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">The Nature Of The Beast</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In this episode we learn some interesting things about the kaiju thanks to Yun and a maritime incursion. Starting with Yun we get to watch the massive Anguirus spar with Jet Jaguar (piloted by
          none other than Goro) who quickly bests the robot and beings to play with the machine, Yun mumbling to himself that the Kaiju is driven by curiosity. Hearing this idea the behavior of the beasts up
          until this point makes perfect sense. They've not invaded an area out for blood, they haven't gone out of their way to cause destruction, it really makes it seem when looking back that the kaiju were
          just incredibly curious and egged on by some sort of exterior factor. Understanding this we see how the Anguirus reacts when being shot at once more, as it's already learnt about guns. They fail of
          course, and Old Man Goro takes the law into his own hands alongside the massive Harpoon Cannon his friend brought along. Using the cannon he makes a charge for the Anguirus and stabs it in the neck
          before detonating the gunpowder at point blank. Somehow Goro manages to successfully take down the Anguirus as we get a shot panning outwards as blood pours from the wound. With the Anguirus dealt with
          we switch to a naval fleet taking on a herd of Manda.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The fleet isn't overly successful in repelling them as several make it past the ships, though don't attack them oddly enough. Quickly though we find
          out the Manda aren't attacking the fleet or mainland, they're running away. A large unidentified object appears on the radar swimming at breakneck speeds, and just as it reaches the ships the monster
          breaches the surface. A massive, terrifying creature stares back at the crewmembers as Godzilla's theme starts to play. The crewmembers watch on in awe as the massive kaiju gives chase to the swarm of
          Manda, shocked that they weren't the target of this massive beast either. As the colossal kaiju continues to herd the Manda it leaves behind a sea of red, chasing them towards the end of Tokyo Bay. In
          shockingly accurate fashion the news shows a massive group of people flocking to the edges of the bay to witness the Manda in person. After the news report finished we spend time with Ms. Kanako and the
          chief officer of the fleet, where Kanako attempts to get information off of him. The officer responds blandly and objectively as you'd expect but Kanako launches a counterattack heavy with philosophy
          and religion which grabs his attention. Sadly we don't get to spend more time with them as we move back to the Anguirus which seemingly comes back to life.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Yun quickly dispels the notion of it coming back to life and argues it was just asphyxiated by the harpoon. Regardless of how it's still alive, the Anguirus is in fact alive and it's backed into a corner.
          Goro attempts to end the bout between JJ and Anguirus quickly but instead of succeeding he manages to fail as the Anguirus uses its large tail to keep Jet Jaguar at a distance and knocks the head of the robot
          clean off. Due to the head behind lopped off and Goro injured, Yun takes control and becomes the eyes of Jet Jaguar to work in tandem to take the Anguirus down. Yun uses his intelligence to catch the Anguirus
          off guard, slamming on the brakes whilst Anguirus charges after them full speed. Thanks to this move the Anguirus is caught completely by surprise and is shot at point blank by Yun and JJ, finally ending the rampage
          of Anguirus. After the monster dies Yun succumbs to the explosion and falls unconscious, after all he's just a person. While unconscious we get to hear some words from the media's favorite scientist on Kaiju. Just as
          Yun predicted earlier, the scientist confirms that the Kaiju effectively control their evolution. While not a revelation to viewers by any means, it's acceptance by a major scientific body gives it massive credibility
          and makes for a concerning acceptance of the situation. Episode 6 overall is a hard to swallow pill in terms of reality. The ability to rewrite DNA on the fly, tides died a murderous color of red, immortal jellyfish
          and potentially people, hell, existence, annihilation. The list keeps going on, there's a terrifying amount of realizations that occur in the episode, some for the better and some for the worse. That's how science
          progresses though, we're not given objectively bad or good conclusions, just, to some degree, answers. It doesn't hold our hand on what we're being told (which can be a turn off I understand) but it lets you run
          free with the information thanks to that lack of a helping hand. There's nothing to tell you it's right or wrong based on how they explain it, and they have no intention of making it easily understood. For that reason
          I love watching this series, you have to take the deeper dive to understand what the characters are saying at times. You're the one that has to go off and do research and double check facts and information. It's so
          interactive and interesting despite being a show. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">It's an amazing way to spend 20 minutes (at minimum) and exposes you to so many cool theories and ideas, anyone interested in anything academic should be watching this show.</h4>
