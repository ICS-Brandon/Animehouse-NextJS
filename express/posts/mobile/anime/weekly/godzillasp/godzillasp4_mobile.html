        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
              The start of the episode begins with us learning about what happened to the flock of Radon from the previous episode. Once again we meet with the head scientist who
              talks about the Radon and find the journalist that had met with Mei is there as well. He seems to play the Devil's Advocate as he asks leading questions like "Will
              more of these giant creatures be visiting us soon? For example, a wingless terrestrial creature that walks on four- or even two legs.". He speaks with such swagger
              and calmness that it's almost like he already knows the answer to that question, the look on his face after asking making it plain to see he's thinking ahead of what
              he has asked. Soon after we come back to Mei attempting to solve the code that Yun had sent to her. She debates back and forth with her AI, confused that if it's
              supposed to make sense when it's solved that it should be solvable.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Quickly though her AI companion Pero 2 picks up on the fact that it's a hash, choosing to try MD5
          first. Anyone remotely familiar with hashing will know where this is going right away but those that don't get lead on for a little bit as Mei attempts various words
          and sentences to output the correct value. For those not familiar with hashing all that well we get a cute little explanation from Pero 2 likening it to hash browns,
          "It would be difficult to restore the original potato from a hash brown. It's only towards the end of the episode Mei cracks the code when assuming her suitcase to be
          locked. "But how can a suitcase be locked if the key is inside?", the answer being that the suitcase isn't locked. In the end the MD5 hash was a quiz for Mei to give
          her a better understanding of what Archetype is, a question that's the answer. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Something that is unable to exist but does anyway, something that couldn't be discovered

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Opinions Running Rampant</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The show has been thriving on giving the viewer as many view points and perspectives as possible and continues to do so this episode. In the beginning we meet a new Kaiju
          with the fisherman from earlier, and after the opening we're taken directly to the media covering the Radon flock incursion. Immediately the screen shows a large group of
          Radon corpses being lined up on a beach, their blood or whatever liquid it may be darkening the sand around them. The media gives some numbers for the invasion of Radon as
          Yun and Haberu attempt a half-baked setup for Misakioku, believing them to be the source of the song. Quickly however, Satou dispels all concerns the two had about them. We
          of course meet with the head scientist, which was outlined earlier. Skipping further in after our problem solving session with Mei we come back to the media covering the Radon,
          asking more sensational questions than ever, with even more questionable sources and information. Quickly social media run away with the information that the media gives them
          and come up with all sorts of ideas, some more meaningful than others. The point here being that the show is giving us as much information as possible without making a single
          character all knowing, and also throwing us off the trail of the truth as everyone's ideas and opinions aren't guaranteed to line up easily for us. It makes for a satisfying game
          of Cat And Mouse mixed with searching for a needle in a haystack. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">You know where the story is going roughly but you don't know which thread to pull on that will lead you to the
          correct answer.</h4>
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Bones With Will And Trapping Light</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Failing to have caught Misakoku red handed they opt to meet with Satou at the mass gravesite of the Radon. Here Yun and Haberu talk back and forth about how quickly the Radon have
          adapted to their environment, citing the possibility that they can evolve at will. While in thought Satou drives up to them to further discuss the musical incident, accidentally revealing
          the bones in the basement of Misakioku. After Satou quickly leaves Yun notices that a Radon corpse is missing before we get to meet Professor Li and see archetype in action for the first
          time. We get to see an awe-inspiring demonstration of the ability of archetype as it traps light in a system, and then that same light increases in intensity until the demonstration
          shatters itself. In the meanwhile Mei thinks to herself as to the cause of this nature, and finds the answer right away. The light isn't trapped in the system, it's appearing in the system
          an infinite amount of times from the future. The light exhibited exists in our present but being able to trap it and increase its intensity is from the light of the future materializing
          in that specific position, creating the illusion of growing in intensity. In very cute fashion Mei becomes embarrassed due to her outburst in explaining her theory and sits back down until
          the presentation is done. Afterwards she talks with Li a little bit and gets the assignment of writing a report on her theory to give to her tomorrow. After her talk with Li we move back to
          Yun and Haberu as they cross paths with the journalist in their search for the missing Radon. Incidentally they're lead right towards it as the military ended up finding the not-so-Radon
          first, giving their position to the three thanks to some gunfire.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">An Answer That Is The Question</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          While all this action and suspense is happening on Yun's side of the story, Mei is on her way to meet with Professor Li due to her interest in Mei's research papers. While on the train to her
          destination we get introduced to another aspect of the story, the Archetype particle. In the midst of undestanding it we're interrupted by the people on the train learning of the flock of Rodan.
          While this doesn't affect Mei greatly she ends up lending a helping hand to Yun while sending a robot to check on her laundry of all things. The robot ends of crossing paths with Yun and
          Haberu and helps distract some of the Rodan as they push onward. After the events of the Rodan flock are completed we come back to Mei who is meeting with a very charismatic journalist who
          serves as a middle man to invite Mei to a conference that Professor Li is holding. After their meeting Yun manages to get in contact with Mei to thank her for her intervention with the Rodan
          and the conversation begins to transition to the flower encased in a cube that Mei had received from the journalist. Thanks to Yun's knowledge Mei realizes that the flower inside exists in a
          way that isn't possible. Yun explains it to be the Archetype particle that Professer Li is researching. She asks for hints from him but all he gives her is a test to solve a string of characters.
          The overall nature of this archetype particle is unknown to us at the moment but it's clear that it does some really interesting stuff. Of course it also has something to do with the Kaiju
          as we're being told about it but just learning about it alone is going to be incredibly interesting given the mystery around it.
