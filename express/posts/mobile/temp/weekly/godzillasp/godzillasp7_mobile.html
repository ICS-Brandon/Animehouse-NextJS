          We start off exactly where where we were left in the previous episode, the massive unnamed water creature chasing after a herd of Manda as they make their way into the Tokyo Bay. As they attempt
          to flee their predator a sea of red is left behind in their wake and soon enough they become cornered. The massive kaiju wastes no time in killing them, splattering copious amounts of blood across
          city buildings, obstructing the view of everyone awe-struck by the monster. After disposing of the Manda the kaiju makes landfall, wandering into an open green space/park. The oddest thing to notice
          is that the monster no longer looks as red and sleek as it did when it breached the water previously. Right now it looks scaly and rough and is a different color altogether. Even further is it's
          emitting tons of red dust, forming a massive cloud around itself, making it hard to see the beast in its entirety. Undoubtedly, thanks to the spikes on its back, this kaiju is meant to be Godzilla.
          What we're left with though is what Stage of Godzilla is this? It was first a creature of the deep, something  similar to a mosasaur, but now it's developed a body more apt for use on the land. We've
          seen this happen before with Radon and Anguirus, but Radon became a different species when it forced itself to evolve, would that mean that neither of these are actually "Godzilla"? Some really
          interesting science and theory to try and make heads and tails of, but moving on an odd silence befalls Tokyo with the arrival of "Godzilla" and his red cloud. To start off no other kaiju appear for a
          while, but before long Radon begin to show up, and in close proximity to "Godzilla". They don't appear from their usual location off the coast by Yun and Haberu and everyone, instead they spawn in
          close proximity to this "Godzilla" and the red dust it emits. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">What's even scarier is that the Radon are appearing all over the world now, and they're more aggressive than earlier. We even learn that
          there's reports of them being essentially immortal when within the red dust.</h4>

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After hearing about Ashihara and his fascination with the red tide and jellyfish we follow Mei as she goes searching for pieces of Ashihara's research so she can better understand archetype.
          Despite finding a good bit of it she's unable to make heads or tails of what she's looking at. It's only when Mei's sat down at a table in the library she was in that sense is able to be made
          of what looks like scribbles. Mei isn't the one that decodes it entirely though, the woman seen in the previous episodes, Ms. Kanako (foreign affairs, we find out), is the one that gives Mei
          the initial push. Ashihara's notes intertwine music and philosophy and poetry with his complex math and science, and it just so happens Kanako recognizes the references. The pair are two sides
          of the same coin as Kanako unravels the complex wordplay for Mei and poses the correct questions to help her dive deeper. We get to experience an interesting conversation where existentialism,
          religion, and philosophy playfully flirt with concrete theory, math, and sciences. While the two engage in their conversation Mei aimlessly doodles on a page as she recalls Kanako's comment about
          fearful symmetry and realizes what's happening. In classic nerd fashion Mei gets excited about her breakthrough and rushes away, forgetting her books and belongings momentarily. Making a break
          for Professor Li Mei begins to explain Ashihara's Cascade, and does so in a familiar fashion to some. She takes a single strip of paper, a 6 written on one end and a 9 on the other, and in folding
          the paper they both become the same number with one over top of the other, the once rectangular strip now taking the shape of a triangle. In the closest approximation what's going on here is Mei
          is proving how time is warped and bent around the object to produce the effects of time travel. My personal favorite of this example is taking a piece of paper, folding it in half and poking a hole
          in it. The paper represents our 3 dimensional space and time flowing from left to right, folding it being a literal fold in time which produces what seems like time travel. It's essentially the
          reverse explanation of the 6 = 9 paper. Some very awesome stuff to cover for sure, though difficult to understand given the complex terminology that Mei uses.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Being Drip Fed The Future</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Something that might not be picked up on right away from this episode is the fact that we've been being shown the future for 7 episodes now. It hasn't been hidden in little details, it's not being
          behind puzzles and questions. The future has been right underneath our noses the entire time. What I'm talking about is the opening of the show. The opening of the show is entirely made up of pieces
          of various episodes in the show, though not in order. It took embarrassingly long for myself to catch it, only realizing after a second watch of an earlier episode while writing the review, but rather
          than ruin the fun by commenting on it right away I've waited until it's painfully obvious and that there were enough chances to catch it. The moments for this episode were the lights covered in red dust
          in Tokyo at the beginning, the shot of Salunga being pelted with bullets, etc. etc. Every single frame of detail in the opening is taken from the show. There's scenes of the aquatic Godzilla twisting
          tails with Manda in Tokyo, there's scenes of Jet Jaguar with the harpoon cannon in hand. There's even BB taking the elevator down to drop a surprise on Salunga. Towards the end we see the Manda being
          chased into Tokyo bay even. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">We've been shown the future of Godzilla Singular Point since the beginning, but like the characters in the show we've had no way to make heads or tails of it until we see those
          scenes.</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          At the beginning it might have been a coincidence with one or two scenes, but almost half of the scenes in the opening can be proven to be directly lifted from the show itself and simply been given
          an artistic flair to match the style of the opening. It's incredible how much they put in and none of it is easily picked out until you've already experienced the match. Until you recognize you're being fed
          the future you don't realize that it is the future. Even things like the doodles from Ashiharas' notes are in the opening all over the place. What makes this so wildly interesting is this opening makes it
          possible to perhaps see the future of the show. If you pause at a specific moment in the opening you can see a collage of moments and a 3x3 grid. We can see things like the first Radon, the large Anguirus,
          the red light from the basement, etc etc. What's interesting here is the things you don't recognize. I won't go into detail about what there is in the opening that we haven't seen, but just drop a hint that
          there's a lot in there that details how the rest of the series will go.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Looking Both Ways</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Godzilla Singular Point does something really interesting in its storytelling. The majority of the focus is on the future of the world, since it's at stake and all. Always looking forward means never looking back,
          and that's where Godzilla SP gets you. It's constant information overload of the future and its contents stops you from dreaming about the past. All the characters look forward despite their information from the past.
          Because of that they're getting tripped up in spots, like Yun with the information from the song. That's not to say there's not a single character looking back, people like the journalist with the skeleton in the
          basement and BB with Ashihara's prophecy are fixated on the past and present. The issue here is they have the wrong perspective because they've been looking backwards. These two sides have to become one to understand
          what's happening. Borrowing a bit of religious imagery from Ms. Kanako, one cannot have heaven without hell and vice versa. A future cannot exist without a present and past, nor a past without present and future. Each
          group is guilty of neglecting a piece of time, and I believe this is why they can't solve the puzzle. Seeing time as something other than the ever marching reminder of our finite existence is a challenge. In order to
          work with it in the same way as other dimensions you need to see it as a dimension. Solving this puzzle of perceiving time is what Yun and Mei are on the verge of uncovering, and plays a critical role in their understanding
          of what's happened, happening, and will happen. Time is the most fickle thing in the human brain to understand at times due to our perception of it, but that's what Godzilla Singular Point aims to tackle using archetype,
          and of all things Kaiju. Not something you'd ever think would go together but with the skill and knowledge of the team behind this show it feels like a match made in heaven. I can't wait to see where we're taken next with
          the existence of the big bad guy and prophecies of the end of times floating around in peoples' heads.
