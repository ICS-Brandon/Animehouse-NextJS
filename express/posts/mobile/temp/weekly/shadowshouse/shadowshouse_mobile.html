        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          To make a long story short, if you like The Promised Neverland (Season 1) then you'll like Shadow's House. It follows a similar style wherein Living
          Dolls are taken in by the Shadow family to be their servants and they immediately pile on the doubts. For those who haven't watched The Promised
          Neverland, Shadow's House is a rather slow burn at the moment without any action or anything, mostly just light drama and plenty of character
          development and worldbuilding. It flips, sometimes violently, back and forth between the horror and discomfort that's insinuated, and the lighthearted
          and happy nature of the main character. If you aren't committed to a well-thought out story that doesn't rush itself this isn't for you. If you're
          looking for a show that keeps you captivated and trying to guess where it takes you next, and don't mind the lack of action then I couldn't recommend
          this show more.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Second Side To Everything</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Shadow's House plays on duality incredibly heavily, and with its content and characters it works perfectly. The humans of Shadow House are shown to
          be 3 dimensional shadows in the cold open of silence and background music in the first episode. Immediately eyebrows are raised at everything: the
          fantastical industrial revolution-esque mansion, the sheer size of the house, all the tasks being done, and then the train emitting a deep black
          soot is shown as it makes its way up to the house. On this it carries one of our main characters, a Living Doll. There's more still but for now I'm
          skipping the rest of the plot to go right to the opening which makes more sense to be attached to this curiosity. <h4 class = "interjectTitle brightText">
          The opening plays on every aspect of duality and curiosity that those first few moments raised and then some. </h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The characters dance in pairs on a stage and are shown swapping with one
          another, each pair of dancers looking nearly identical (though one is a shadow and the other a Living Doll). The opening also plays with negative
          space in the shadows of a few characters to show places in the mansion. This entire take is covered in head to toe with story and information that
          will slowly make sense as we learn more about Shadow's House, but for now, on the visuals alone consider me hooked. The styling, the sense of
          curiosity, horror, and discomfort, the understanding of something evil. There's just so much going on to set the tone of the story, and each
          frame makes perfect use of it to provide an incredibly eerie and unique introduction entrenched with duality.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">A Grim And Doubtful First Encounter</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          To pick up where left off in the story of Shadow's House, the train is shown alongside a few other scenes of Shadow House family members, and
          then it changes to a Shadow pouring out drinks into small shot glasses. Each of these glasses is given to what looks like a child as they drink it
          and then recite an incredibly eerie speech, "Let us ever remember. The Shadow's are an outstanding family of nobles. To serve them is the pride and
          joy of every living doll.". This alone should have everyone questioning the reality and existence of these "Living Dolls". Are they actual dolls and
          this is some sort of acclimation procedure? Are they human and being made into dolls? There are plenty of questions to be answered in just this
          scene. As a little interjection, during this speech scene there's a piece where the two Shadow family members administering the drinks turn to look
          at each other, taking up the majority of the screen. In this moment the only child/doll that remains visible is our main character.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          As the tone
          switches the "Dolls" are shown to be lying perfectly still on what definitely seem like coffins and some foreboding organ music swells, our main
          character front and center again. As a door beings to close, removing all light from the room, small little ghost-like shadows float into view atop
          each "Doll". Just as the door finally shuts the shadow of a girl seemingly sits up only to be masked by the blackness. After this moment our main
          character awakes in that same box they fell asleep on, the box being eerily similar to a coffin with an added grate to look out of.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">A Character-Centric Story</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Shadow's House is quite the slow burn in terms of story and interest, opting to focus largely on its characters and moving them forward, allowing
          the plot to follow naturally. With the setting and understanding of the show this decision makes sense as the main character, a Living Doll, is shown
          to only interact directly with the Shadow family member she serves named Kate. This complete and total isolation and lack of understanding perfectly
          sets up exposition for the audience, as well as a great chance for our Living Doll to grow and learn. This episode occurs in 2 places, the room of
          the Living Doll, and the room of the Shadow family member Kate. The Living Doll is tasked with being a servant to Kate, cleaning up all of the
          soot that the Shadow family member produces. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">This first episode largely revolves around each getting used to the other,
           the Living Doll understanding who, and to a degree what, Kate is and Kate understanding the empty slate that is her Living Doll servant.</h4>
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Blink And You Might Miss It</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          There's no super fast paced action in this episode, no intense discoveries or anything of the sort. What there is, however, is plenty of small nods and
          pieces that explain the Shadows and their existence. While most of it is covered in dialogue the art and animation plays into it heavily as well. The most
          notable part is the use of side profiles with Kate. Because she's a Shadow you can't discern any detail from looking head on, but in the show they make
          use of side-profiles to show emotion and at some points turn her to face head on so you can't read her expression at all. An excellent way to show and
          hide emotion and information from the viewer. Another aspect is the detail in the uses of soot, which we're told is directly correlated to emotion somehow.
          When Kate wakes up she's covered in soot, when she places her hand on the wall in the morning it leaves behind the faint print of soot. When she gets
          anxious in the episode soot is shown to be emanating from her head. These details fade into the background very quickly but they're shown to be
          everywhere and they can add all sorts of information when taken in.

        </div>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Horror And Happiness</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The motto of this show may as well be "Happiness with a side of horror" with how they go about it. The Living Doll is shown to be so happy and energetic
          that the show can't help but absorb her personality, but that doesn't mean that the horror is non-existent. In this first episode it's shown mostly in
          existential ways, such as the Living Doll questioning whether or not she'll be "thrown out" if she breaks while the screen pans to a broken doll in a bag.
          They continue to pose complex questions with the Doll asking why she was created to look like a human. Once Kate answers the question the Doll moves to
          the one everyone was waiting for, Is Kate Human? In a potentially unnoticed movement Kate turns her head so that none of the features of her face are
          visible when she responds. Immediately after this the show snaps back to happiness with the Living Doll enjoying a nice piece of bread. The playfulness
          between blurring the lines of Horror and Lightheartedness is excellently executed and leaves nothing to be desired, aside from more information of course.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Shadow's House feels incredibly close to the "whodunnit" murder mysteries of Live Action movies. There's so many questions, so many curiosities that are
          posed to the viewer within moments of watching. The show makes incredible use of it's "closed-mouth" approach to storytelling, giving the viewer tiny crumbs
          of information to piece together to create intricate theories, wild conspiracies and more. Each scene moves the story forward, even if you don't realise it,
          in such a well-thought out way you can't help but be impressed with the forethought. The mystery of the Shadow House, Living Dolls, and the relationship
          between Kate and her servant remain an important aspect that's to be explored via the duality of these characters.
