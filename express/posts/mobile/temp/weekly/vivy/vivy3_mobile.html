        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Episode 3 finally gives us our first view of the opening for the anime, and it doesn't disappoint. The music is really lighthearted and bubbly as we get to see Diva
          sing on stage in front of a larger crowd. Overall it's fairly laid back and just a nice piece to listen to, however, you can look further into the opening and pick
          out quite a few things. One of the first being a shot of the mainstage in the distance, which is of course Diva's objective. Quickly it turns to showing Diva at the
          spot where her and Matsumoto made their deal as partners, the massive radio tower that all AIs use being shown in the distance. We're even shown Diva's archive once
          again, and it's at this point that those paying attention might recognize the parallel between the lyrics Diva's singing and her actions and surroundings in the
          opening. Overall the planning that went into creating an opening like this alongside the music and animation and art is really impressive. They definitely took their
          time with each piece of the opening to make sure it reflected exactly what they wanted.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the few moments at the closing of the opening we get to see some important
           details as well. The first one to catch your eye would be the android in the crowd. You could make out the small ring light on its neck, plus it stuck out with its
           lifeless expression. The next would be Diva's light flickering red, which would reflect some sort of negative emotion, your first thought would be frustration at
           seeing the AI in the crowd as it means she's not been successful in her mission. The solution becomes muddied however with the next scene, which is of a young girl
           happily clapping in the crowd who looks exactly like a younger version of Momoka. For Diva that sort of thing would be insanely crushing to view, even as an AI. It's
           a very interesting opening that has lots of detail in it and operates as something way more integrated than typical openings. Hats off to the people involved in it.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Matsumoto The Manipulator</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          While Matsumoto definitely comes off as very friendly and warm and positive his AI DNA lurks beneath the surface. We find out with Matsumoto's visit to Diva that 15
        years have passed since the first incident, and that he's been asleep that entire time. In their coming conversation Matsumoto keeps his quippy attitude but the content
        of their conversation is very grim. Diva asks him why Momoka had to die and Matsumoto spits out an incredibly blunt response, "Her death was an accident. Plain and
        simple.". For an AI that mimics being a human so well there's moments where his processing just don't line up, and it makes for an interesting character. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle"> He behaves and
        acts like a human, but when it comes down to it Matsumoto still relies on a bunch of ones and zeros to exist.</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Diva however is showing some change, which even Matsumoto recognizes.There's anger showing in her voice, there's facial expressions that Matsumoto comments on. In the 15 years Diva's developed further while Matsumoto has stayed
          the same, still ever-living for the mission. On the topic of mission Matsumoto attempts to egg Diva on to continue her mission. He does so by mentioning the main stage
          and essentially manipulating Diva's programming and directive to serve his ends. It's a really hard topic to justify and while it's impossible to hate teddy bear Matsumoto,
          if he were a human being he'd be among some of the worst with his positive attitude but grim outlook and questionable tactics. It really works well to put a solid line
          between what Matsumoto and the AI of the future is and what AI began life as in Diva.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Hospitality And Robots</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Two words you wouldn't really put together, right? Well Vivy disagrees with that as Diva's next objective is to stop a space hotel from crashing into Earth and taking countless
          lives. With how much commentary there is on humanity and heart and existence you can easily lose sight of the lofty objectives Diva has. Nonetheless Diva has to sneak on board
          the hotel to stop its owner, an AI named Estella from crashing the massive hotel into the Earth. While at the hotel she gets to interact with a lot of newer AI units that
          show their gap in age with their far more nuanced conversations, facial expressions, and reactions. The first thought would be to think that the AI are "faking" these actions
          and reactions but a scene in which Estella and Diva talks tells a different story. Estella asks Diva what she thinks of space and immediately calls out what Diva was doing
          without looking at her. She goes on to explain that while all Diva does is see if space is dangerous that humans don't care about the danger. That we're absorbed by the endless
          expanse that lays in front of us and all thoughts melt away in awe and desire to understand and explore. While Estella doesn't share the thoughts she certainly longs for them
          with how she speaks of it. She can't be human yet she longs for the feeling of humanity. Even when we get a close up on Estella it shows us eyes that look like a human's, not the
          typical close ups we get with Diva.  It really shows humanity shining through in those few moments that can't be grasped or understood by Estella despite it being right there
          inside her. It's a really interesting line to walk because AI like Estella are so close to humanity that they can taste it, yet they will never make it there. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">It's a bit of a
          curse, to be a near perfect being but realize that perfection is what stands in the way of what you truly want.</h4>
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">All About Heart</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The episode ends without much trouble other than a piece of equipment malfunctioning, which allowed us to be treated to another song this time sung by Estella. The song itself is
          very beautiful but it's a double edged sword in its presentation. The entire time singing Estella is emotionless in her expression and they show her as something very inhuman in the design,
          the eyes looking incredibly robotic, the skin and hair way too smooth, everything just perfectly uncanny to make her seem heartless. They lyrics and scenery though present a different message.
          Estella is longing for her old friend that was the previous owner of the hotel. The views in the scenes and the lyrics line up perfectly for the meaning and it all falls into place as we're
          shown eyes and faces full of wonder and excitement at the limitless beauty that lays in front of them. With the end of the episode we're left with the same question that was asked at the start
          of the episode, </h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">"What does it mean to put your heart into something?"</h4>
