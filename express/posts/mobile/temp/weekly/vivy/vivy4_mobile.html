          The episode first shows us a glimpse into the past of an AI that Toak picks up in a trash pile. Quickly however we're returned to Diva confronting Momoka's younger sister
          once the opening is finished. Before the conversation can end Estella announces some issues with the ship that she relays to the AI as an error of unknown origin. Hearing
          that Diva escorts Momoka's sister to somewhere safe to come across Estella in the hallway. Nothing seems out of place until Diva notices Estella isn't wearing her wristband.
          Just in the nick of time Matsumoto is able to help Diva and Yuzuka escape from the imposter. In making their escape they nearly run into Toak so Diva and Yuzuka are forced
          to duck into a cargo hold, where they come across the severed head of the android from the previous episode. These opening minutes provide a direction contradiction to the
          very nature of Diva, allowing for a greater separation between her actual self and the manufactured persona of Vivy. Diva is far more calm and restrictive than Vivy, and also
          far less human. When Diva is acting as Vivy she takes on more traits of humanity and has a more defined personality. This sort of stuff is evident in the moments before Vivy
          turns badass. In the cargo hold she covers the AI's body, attempts to calm Yuzuka with a technique that was taught to her by Momoka, and even tells Matsumoto to upload the
          combat system to herself. In previous episodes none of this would even be considered by Diva in the slightest. <h4 class ="brightText interjectTitle">Her experiences are making an effect on her and these are largely
          reflected in her alter personality, though Diva exhibits some of the similar changes due to overlap in protocol and personality.</h4>

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Once Diva regroups with the actual Estella we learn of the truth of the situation, Estella has an identical sister. When I say identical I mean Identical, The same parts,
          the same logic, the same directive, everything. On our way to intercept the sister Elizabeth we learn of how the two came to be. Estella began as a hospitality AI that was
          to be used for an experiment. The experiment in question was having a single AI develop itself while feeding the information to another to see if it would succeed in creating
          what would essentially be an Identical AI. Of the two siblings Estella was the only one allowed to move freely within her room. Elizabeth had no experiences other than the
           ones given to her by Estella. Their sorrow was shared, their desire for happiness was one, and the urge to be something closer to human was shared. Despite all of these
           thoughts that welled within the twins they never met and Elizabeth was never freed. Once the experiment ran its course Elizabeth was discarded and her sister allowed to enter
           the workforce. The cruelty defined in these scenes is through the roof. The trapping of such an overwhelmingly aware AI in a single room for experimentation, the restriction
           of abilities of a cognitively capable AI in the name of science, so many atrocities committed despite the progress that AI had made in integrating with humanity. It really
           makes you wonder which side is to blame for the coming war.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">The Fulfilment Of A Mission</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After the catch up on who exactly Elizabeth is we're shown her finalizing the course of the Sunrise, the leader of Toak looking on. After the course is set the leader ends up seeing Diva
          on a camera view and attempts to make his way out to face her. The only mistake he makes is telling Elizabeth that her mission is complete. With those words she acts freely and stops the
          leader from wasting his life and directs the group of Toak to an extra escape ship while she moves forward to face Diva. She meets Estella and Diva in a room just before the controls with
          Estella attempting to talk Elizabeth down. She wastes too much time talking to Elizabeth so Vivy moves forward and begins to fight Elizabeth. The animation and fluidity in this scene is
          absolutely mind blowing. The two fighting are incredibly dynamic but the camera also moves around constantly, always offering a different perspective on the fight. The fight starts off
          rather short lived as Matsumoto uploads a virus to Elizabeth rendering her immobile for a brief period.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In a moment of weakness Estella asks Beth why she is doing this, where we come to
          find her motive. It's something so horrible yet so pure and heartbreaking. Elizabeth was casted out by all of those around her, by the people she was meant to serve. How could she be
          grateful to humanity like that? The Toak leader was the one that gave her a purpose, a second chance at existence so how could she go against someone that gave her a second chance? It's a
          moment that manages to break the surface into the territory of humanity if only for a brief moment, and if only through the worst circumstances. It's a beautiful moment sullied by the notion
          that Toak took Beth in to use her, and that Beth accepted it because all she desired was to be wanted by someone. After her explanation she gains a second wind to fight on against Vivy as
          the music reaches a beautiful crescendo full of the emotion of the fight in Beth. Thankfully Vivy fends off Beth and manages to knock her out with a headbutt. The irony here is the reference
          earlier to touching heads to convey information/emotion, so while it's very much a cool way to end the fight its meaning runs deeper than that.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">The End Of An Everlasting Sunrise</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the end it's too late to stop the sunrise from crashing so Estella must stay behind to limit the amount of damage done to the earth. In a bitter sweet final moment Estella and Vivy touch
          heads one final time before Vivy departs. A sad crescendo begins to grow as Estella takes apart the Sunrise. While working at the terminal an explosion blows Estella back into a wall where she
          reflects on her life and inability to save her sister. We are given a brief flashback to Estella being told the news about her sister, where she is in a dark room and in here we're shown the bird
          cage that once held two is now only one. From the hallway Estella came from Beth emerges, though her memories are slightly different due to her fight with Diva. The two share a bittersweet final
          encounter as they work to lessen the damage caused by the sunrise. The song sung by Estella in the previous episode once again graces our ears as we watch the final moments of the Sunrise. The
          emotion in this episode reaches an all time high for Vivy so far and it's impossible to not feel it. To not feel the desire to be human and wanted, the desire for compassion and to be wanted, the
          need to have a purpose. Every last detail of this episode screams out in emotion at what is occurring. What is right isn't always right, as Beth was given the mission of causing a catastrophe,
          but only a single person was willing to give her a purpose in life. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">The horror of being without purpose is a very human concept and to see an AI outwardly struggle with it was not something I
          would expect, then again I wouldn't have expected anything that Vivy has graced us with.</h4>
