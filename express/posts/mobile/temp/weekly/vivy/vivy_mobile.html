        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Is It Worth Watching?</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Something to first understand is that Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song is a story penned by the same author as Re: Zero, Tappei Nagatsuki. While Re: Zero isn't universally
          popular, it is fairly well known. Re: Zero is a story revolving around a young boy with a power he has coined "Return By Death" which drives the story forward.
          Overall it is very much a shounen type show through and through. Vivy, on the other hand doesn't follow that strict typing. It's dark, inhumane and questions the
          very basics of existence and emotion. <h4 class = "interjectTitle brightText">Can you enjoy it by watching an AI fight through the ages to ensure the survival of the human race against the ever-increasing
          intelligence and awareness that AI are developing?</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Absolutely, and you wouldn't really feel like it's missing much. But in looking at it in only the prototypical
          shounen lens of yesteryear you miss a large aspect of this show. There is detail in each scene, meaningful dialogue outside of its intense moments, and excellent
          characterization and animation of these androids. So, it's definitely a watch for anyone interested in the shounen genre, but for those that aren't interested in
          that sort of strict typing Vivy offers some deep drama, introspection and existentialism for those willing to be along for the ride.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">A Jarring Entry</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The first episode starts off with exercising the basic premise of the show in an interesting way: a battered woman with blue hair walks
          down a hallway prepping her voice to sing while her inner monologue states, "My mission is to make everyone happy by singing.". Just as she exits the hallway into a
          bright light, the screen glitches as the aspect ratio changes to narrow in and a faded overlay comes atop the scenery. In this view a woman with pink hair walks
          onto the large stage and starts singing whilst the view pans out and smoke and flames are shown rising from the area of the stage. This is where the show sets its tone.
          The AI's of a theme park called NiaLand are shown to be brutally murdering any and all customers. It's not just implied, but shown in some brutal scenes of
          small spherical drones crashing into people's heads to kill them, skulls being crushed, and people being ran over by vehicles.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The only indication of hostility
          outside of their actions is the AIs glowing red marker on their necks. Each and every humanoid android has this marker and it is shown to be glowing red to
          associate it with violence. Since their true emotions/actions aren't being shown the episode decides to crank the level of disturbance to near its max as the
          pink-haired woman continues her high-energy, happy song as a massacre ensues. The mix of positive imagery with negative actions does wonders to set up the show and
          our understanding of artificial intelligence.

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">What Artificial Intelligence Means To This Show</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After this brtual scene is fully played out and the groundwork is laid for the story we are introduced to how AI came to be in this world. In a logical turn of events
          the developers had initially tried to create AI with the objective of being an All In One unit, which was shown to be a near immediate failure. With this in
          mind they created the first Single Objective Artificial Intelligence, Diva, an android with the sole objective of making people happy through song. With this
          they establish an important aspect of the story that is touched upon frequently. The advent of singular objective AI's causes the world begins a dangerous path
          that leads to the war AI's enact against humanity. The usage of this single objective is very interesting and unique in that the AI allows the objective to
          be manipulated to justify actions. While someone's objective may be to sing really well, if it can be rationed that something will make them sing better they
          will undertake the task. This definition and usage allows for very nuanced understanding and questioning for each AI.
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fIx8yq4Mp_NgepGaHQBg8MU6QNw6cDWWRya3Dx6jExIP40J4LKSlAgQ_Se-a7JD81lIvEvoOh8A6ayfyzRwwPXLnr0mFeD-R61DIfTcv-Jj3XD075g-XnjTLeRjOpJJcRExrLdn6gQ=w2400"/>
        </div>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Animation And Androids</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Animation is something that's always fluid and full of life and character, whereas androids can be stiff and calculated, not making any unnecessary movements
          or gestures. Vivy manages to capture this duality perfectly. With the main character Diva in episode one they show her smiling and happy on stage in one moment
          and then in the next as she recedes into the shadows the smile immediately fades. Within the same piece she is shown striking a pose that she thought may be
          useful since she had seen an idol do it before. The movements for the pose are very graceful and soft without sudden movement. Within the first moments of
          being shown Diva it's very much established what level of AI she is. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">There is no sense of self, no understanding of existence and no interest in the
          technically unnecessary. </h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          They continue to highlight this rift with a young girl Momoka who has befriended Diva. The girl
          clearly shares a bond with Diva and cares for her while Diva does not quite understand and is unable to properly reciprocate. The art keeps focus on
          this by showing Momoka next to Diva, as Momoka's skin tone is far more natural and lifelike where Diva's is whiter and pale. The rift between humanity and
          android is illustrated to be massive at the start of this episode and briefly shows the massive mountain that Diva must climb. Within this episode they also
          like to zoom in on Diva's eyes, showing the detail of them and the effective emotional deadness. They don't make these comparisons explicit but when you
          pay attention there are countless pieces of animation and art that show who and what Diva is.
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">The Struggle For Existence</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The majority of the first episode revolves around Diva's life as a stage performer, and her objective to make it to the "main stage", the largest stage at
          NiaLand. Within these first few moments It's clearly shown that it's purely her objective to reach the stage, there's no desire or interest in what is done.
          It's only once the plot is introduced to the viewer that a change begins to stir. When preparing to start her next performance after her talk with Momoka,
          Diva is suddenly rendered "unconscious"  and awakes in a digital place named "The Archive", a database for all the AIs in use. In this scene the colors and art change drastically as they
          become more bright and vibrant, and almost washed out by the bright lights coming from the windows in this digital room Diva is in.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Upon closer inspection
          the room mimics that of a high school music classroom with music stands set up, and a grand piano at the back where Diva stands. Diva herself has changed
          as well, in this imagery she wears a schoolgirl uniform and her skin tone looks more natural. While asking the Archive what happened she walks over to the
          window and grazes the keys of the piano with her hand as she passes. Once she makes it to the window we're shown her face in a reflection. The most notable
          difference being that her eyes are like a person's, not the hardware that you see in the first closeup shot of her face. This scene begs many questions.
        </p>
        <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Is
        this how Diva sees herself? Is this how she wants to be seen? Or is this the default protocol of an AI to better fulfill the lifestyle and existence of
        someone who's objective is purely to sing?</h4>

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">A Saviour For Humanity, And An AI From The Future That Talks Really Fast</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          While in this dream-like state a robot comes crashing through the window to talk about Diva and set up the plot for the show. The AI that introduces itself,
          and does so very cheerily, is an artificial intelligence sent from 100 years in the future to help Diva save humanity from eradication by AI. Of course the
          thought process is absurd to even AI so to convince Diva, the self-named Matsumoto shows her the visions of the future we were treated to at the start
          and exposes information about a targeted attack on an official that will occur within the park. In a split second of calculation Diva does what any AI
          would do, and makes a break for the scene. She makes it to the official just in time to save him as the explosion targeted as a warning to him goes off.
        </p>
        <div style = "width:100%">
          <img class = "mobileImageFit" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1GckdvDc17QPhlFcbR1M9ld1zZ2QTAKwYcCmckqG-y4ZH9w9oB7EIr5NWoTBXq8wEOe27wq9Vr-DM5omAoAiIhi8pIK8KDwGKP4yinXHPLqUMNuaCM6EeZXKGPhfVNbSB23BiNRWDg=w2400"/>
        </div>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent" style = "padding-top:2%">
          The movements as Diva runs through the streets are awkwardly stiff and fit perfectly into an uncanny valley. However, in saving the official and avoiding
          his bodyguards her movements suddenly become very fluid and lifelike. These two scenes highlight the effectiveness and styling of artificial intelligence.
          In running there is most definitely inefficiencies in the movement of a person, but in the make or break moments like saving someone calculations aren't
          purely all that matters. With the savoir of this official Diva essentially signs on to save humanity with the help of Matsumoto, despite that fact that
          he is endlessly annoying to Diva (mostly due in part to his more human speech patterns).
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">A Robot On The Path To Humanity, Almost</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The episode leaves us at the end with Diva disguised carrying Matsumoto in the form of a teddy bear attempting to protect the official from being murdered
          so that they can stop a dangerous AI related law from being passed in his name. This episode end raises many questions and possible contradictions,
          such as: Why is she trying to save someone if her objective is to make people happy by singing? My answer to that is this, the official makes a
          comment about wanting to hear Diva sing at some point so with that explicit remark Diva is in a way required, or for better wording allowed, to save
          the official's life. Even still, with the given ambiguity of these objectives in the first episode she would be allowed to save anyone as they have
          the potential to become happy due to her singing. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">The story itself perfectly understands its own rules and outlines which allows for a very tight plot
          that explores the intertwined fates of Humanity, Artificial Intelligence, and the robot tasked with saving the world.</h4>
