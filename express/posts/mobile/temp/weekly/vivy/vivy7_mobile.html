          Episode 7 starts out with Diva on the main stage of NiaLand, her lifelong goal. The stands are filled to the brim with excited fans, erupting into joy when she walks onto the stage. During the
          performance one of her rabid fans makes it past security to give her flowers. The mood is at an all time high in NiaLand as everyone is captivated by her stellar performance. The singing superb,
          the choreography captivating, the styling stellar, Diva is nailing every last detail of the performance in a way her original self couldn't imagine. After the performance is finished she meets
          with her support staff, doling out high fives and congratulations along the way. She even deals with the regret and guilt of the staff member that let the man slip by in a graceful manner,
          incorporating some of Estella's words into her talk. And it's here that the illusion begins to fall apart. Regardless we move forward to find Diva in what seems to be the same lodgings as
          previously, though it looks more lived in. There's pictures on the wall and other decorative pieces to give life to the space. Diva also brings a different air to herself this episode as she
          interacts more candidly and with more interest in her voice with her companion stage AI. They even sling jokes at one another. It's plain as day that Diva's drastically changed. Though it's not
          like it's happened overnight, we're shown pictures of people aging over the years so we know it's been a long time. It's just a question of when Diva reached her goal and how long it took her to
          get to the state she's currently in. Regardless of these questions she's achieved her goal, and cheerfully so. She's full of energy and life, Diva's acting like she's finally alive and not some
          robot that's only meant to sing and nothing else. With her ability she's made herself world famous as a singing AI, getting invited to the massive Zodiac Signs Festival. In light of that revelation
          she excitedly prepares for her performance.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">The Small Theater Fairy</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Once Diva makes it to the Zodiac Signs Festival she's introduced to one of her youngest sisters, Ophelia. The way we're introduced to Ophelia is very interesting given her namesake. The first time
          we meet Ophelia it's because she falls into the basin of a fountain and is drenched in water. Any theater nerds reading might understand the connection right away but for those that don't here's a
          bit of a backstory. In a little play called Hamlet there's a woman named Ophelia, and in this play Ophelia commits suicide by drowning herself. This isn't to say we know Ophelia will die in a way
          similar to this, but just something to keep in mind given the name and her introduction to us. Regardless, Diva volunteers to take care of Ophelia which leads to a passionate conversation between the
          two. Diva taking the role of the cool and calm senior and Ophelia the starstruck junior. We even get some jokes tossed out there about asking about age and the like. It's a very human-like conversation
          between what feels like siblings or partners. Moving forward though we get to hear Ophelia's singing firsthand, the touted Fairy of the Small Theater refusing to disappoint listeners as she delivers an
          amazing rehearsal. Diva's very impressed with Ophelia's showing but promises to one up her in the practice run. Before she can begin though she sees a familiar face in the back of the theater, Kakitani
          of Toak, the young man she saved all those years ago. Her memory immediately sparks up at the sight of him forcing her to leave the stage in pursuit.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">The Humble Guard AI and Pet Theories</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Continuing in pursuit of Kakitani Diva follows him to some storehouse where she's lured to a trap and ambushed by a hacked AI. Matsumoto flies into the rescue however to save her. What's interesting here is he calls her
          Vivy when swooping in to save her, but then refers to her as Diva in the ensuing conversation, calling himself a guard AI. It's here that we're all but told that Diva has no memories of Vivy, and it's easy to think of why.
          Regardless this answers a lot of questions about Diva's behavior in the episode and makes it moderately disturbing to a degree. The first thing I personally picked up on was the snapping that she does. This starts right away
          in the opening and happens throughout the episode all the time. Most would believe this to be a "habit" of someone, but being an AI and having seen the previous episode I couldn't see it as anything other than a nervous tic.
          Something that's done without knowledge and to stop thoughts or actions from occurring. The next on the list of odd and concerning behavior is her excessive use of "pet theories". It's a combination of words she says far too
          many times in the episode. No matter the amount of time elapsed from the previous episode and this these sorts of behaviors are engrained in a person and not something so easily picked up. The next is the use of lines from
          previous experiences that Vivy (in particular) has had. The most notable being the line from Estella about smiling she uses on that staff member at the beginning of the episode. However sincere and cute it simply felt wrong
          and weird to have been used by Diva, and now we know why. Diva doesn't have Vivy at the moment, or at all anymore potentially. It's a dangerous position to be left in considering the resurfacing of Kakitani and all, not to
          mention the position it puts viewers in. There's still 5 episodes to go after this, so how can this be rectified? How can we continue? There's many questions to ask about the existence of Vivy and what's happened to Diva, and
          there's no easy answer. There's no simple explanation for what's happened to either as it seems like a worst case scenario. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Diva's adopted some odd personality that's cobbled together from previous experiences via Vivy, yet
          Vivy doesn't exist within Diva's conscious currently.</h4>

        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">Filling The Hole</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          By the end of the episode Diva faces that which has been missing, Vivy. From the (at moments intense) interactions between Diva and Matsumoto we learn about what's going on with Diva/Vivy and how it happened (end of episode 6).
          Matsumoto tells Diva of what the two accomplished over the years to her disbelief and tells her of what the next step in the Singularity Project is to prevent a first of its kind incident. The suicide of an AI, Ophelia in particular.
          Despite not being Vivy, Diva attempts to help Matsumoto stop the terrible incident from happening. This episode sets us up for a lot of important talks that you wouldn't think about when you hear 'Artificial Intelligence'. The words
          certainly aren't synonymous with things like suicide, PSTD, split personalities, repression, etc. etc. These are things you wouldn't usually see in most anime, let alone one about robots. At the same time though it's the perfect place
          to tackle it. It can't be as sensitive and nuanced in it as something like Wonder Egg Priority, but it's objective view on what they are, how they happen, and their effects is something plenty can learn from. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">Vivy continues to be a show
          that flips standards on their heads while pursuing an incredibly awesome series of action packed missions and objectives as we follow her through time.</h4>
