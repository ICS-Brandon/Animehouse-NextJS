          Episode 8 starts off with Shutaro as he wanders the rubble left by the earthquake. The first scene we get with him is finding the spot where Maeda was impaled, the only thing missing being
          Maeda. Without a place to go or anywhere better to be Shutaro wanders this wasteland as he reminisces of what was. In his brief travels we find out that vampires are commonplace and known by
          the public. We find this out the hard way as Shutaro comes across a group that are infecting other people, forcing them to wander the night aimlessly and without hope. The chaos doesn't last
          long though as Nakajima's Vampire Unit comes out to play, beating and bludgeoning anything that even looks like a vampire. With the state they're in it makes you wonder if Nakajima was totally
          honest with his plan, or if the earthquake threw a wrench in it. What we do know for sure though is the sorry state the city's in. In the area Shutaro's in there's hardly a building that's
          been left standing. Rubble surrounds everyone as people wander from place to place looking for shelter and food. Exhaustion is on everyone's face, including Shutaro. We've got no idea how long
          he's already been wandering for, no help or information on if he's been drinking any blood, no idea of if he's even slept. Regardless of his state he continues to search for his comrades and for
          answers. He attempts to talk to the Vampire Unit but they don't respond at all, but oddly enough they don't attack him either. As they pass him by he's once more left alone in the cold wasteland
          that once was thriving. After a while of wandering Shutaro happens upon an encampment of survivors, where we listen in on the idle chat of a pair talking about leaving. As would be the sentiment
          in that time one of the men defends his decision to stay as he was born and raised there. Rather than attempt to talk to the group Shutaro sits off by himself, but even with isolating himself he's
          not left alone. The pair of kids that saluted to Nakajima in episode 6 come by and give him some onigiri, which regrettably he can't eat. Instead of wasting or refusing it, Shutaro offers it up
          to the buddha statue next to him.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Militarian Versus Humanitarian</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Due to the vast amounts of people left without homes, incomes, etc. the city has set up stations to pick up food and the like. It's largely consistent of volunteers so we get to see that Aoi has
          survived the earthquake, alongside her boss. Her assistance in handing out food doesn't last long though as she runs into her boss, who says he's reviving the newspaper to write about vampires. Quickly
          Aoi hands off the bread duty to him as she runs off, only to catch a glimpse of Shutaro before he disappears. We move forward a bit in time with some military officers trying to clear out some rubble.
          While attempting to bring the rubble down some of the officers talk about a vaccine we had heard about earlier, one of them claiming they had just drank it. Distracting thanks to their talk the pair of
          officers are caught off guard by the rubble falling and nearly get caught in it. Shutaro swoops in to save the day however, to the bewilderment of those involved. Quickly however the thankfulness for
          being saved fades as they become suspicious of him, smoke billowing up from his clothes (thanks to it being daytime). Before anything can happen though, the man that drank the vaccine turns into a vampire
          before their eyes and burns away just as quick. Without a doubt the "vaccine" being administered is still a version of ascra, it's just marketed differently to the public. Nakajima should have full control
          over the situation and he didn't want people to unnecessarily die, but yet here he is distrusting ascra to humans causing countless numbers of death. Alongside the ascra we also have the vampire unit
          indiscriminately killing vampires at night, making this an awfully dark situation. Nakajima's turning everyone into vampires, and in the same stroke killing all those that become vampires. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">It's funny and
          highly hypocritical to see Nakajima abuse his military ranking to do something so horrible in light of how he characterized Shutaro, who is currently doing his best to save and help as many people as he can.</h4>

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">The Past Catching Up With The Present</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          A good chunk of the episode is simply following Shutaro around town as he remembers old memories and moments from his time with Code Zero, and it's these memories that lead to Yamagami's old house. Miraculously
          the building still stands and is inhabitable, but it's in a different district. Regardless, Shutaro crosses the threshold and is met with Yamagami's wife coming out to meet him. In their heartwarming conversation
          his wife mentions that another person had come by and dropped off a trinket that belonged to Yamagami. Even without hearing the few details she has we know it to be Maeda, we just don't know if he's a vampire yet.
          With his conversation over, Shutaro begins to walk the city alone, this time with motivation. He knows Maeda is out there somewhere, it's just a question of finding him. We leave Shutaro to meet once more with
          Rufus and Nakajima, the pair playing chess using ascra as the pieces. They talk about the production and distribution of ascra as if it wasn't killing the population in droves, and once their little game is finished
          Rufus even gets up to celebrate. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle"> The scenes of him happily singing and dancing around are interlaced with scenes of people getting their "vaccines" to create a disturbing moment.</h4>
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          After this moment fades we come
          back to Shutaro wandering the city. In his wanders he comes across a group of vampire children that he saves, and in doing so comes into contact with the Tenmaya finally. He finds out that they've been operating out
          of a private location away from the city, and that they've been overflowing with vampire refugees. With that in mind the head clerk and Shutaro get sent on a mission to retrieve some old blood stores in the underground
          of the city. The two have some smooth sailing ahead of them, before they realize they've been ambushed by Rufus and the Vampire Unit. In a surprising, but not overly important, twist we find out that the head clerk
          is a vampire as well. Tenmaya helping out vampires suddenly makes a lot more sense. Regardless though, the pair don't repel the Vampire Unit, instead one of their own turns against them. You might have thought this
          to be Maeda at first but that isn't quite right. This vampires' eyes turn to a purple and a sort of smoke emits from the suit as they begin to wreak havoc on the rest of their unit. The two take the opportunity to
          escape while Rufus deals with the rogue vampire, and it's here that our episode ends.

        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Episode 8 doesn't take us too far into the story, but instead takes a step back to give us perspective and a breather before we take the plunge. We learn of what's happened to the city after the earthquake, we've seen
          Nakajima and Rufus' plan, and we've seen Shutaro searching for his comrades. Rather than dive into the action once more we're slowly eased into it while being given all sorts of information regarding what's going on in
          the world at this moment of time. We also get to see some interesting behavior from vampires. The most notable being "Danny Boy" as Rufus calls him. Danny Boy exhibits traits that no other vampire has so far, his eyes
          turn purple and he emits some sort of smoke. It's unknown if this is breaking any sort of control or if they simply went berserk. Regardless, it poses many questions as to the use and effectiveness of ascra. It even makes
          me wonder if the purple eyes and aggression were the goal of the ascra. Regardless, episode 8 gives us plenty to think on while setting up the future and final moments of the season as we begin our ascent to the end. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">What
          lies ahead of us? That's anybody's guess, but you can be sure whichever path they take in this story it will be just as good as everything that came before it.</h4>
