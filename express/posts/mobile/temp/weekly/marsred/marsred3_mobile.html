        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Excellent Sound Design</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Episode 3 turns it up a notch in a lot of areas to make for an impressive episode but at the time of writing this the sound design is what really caught
          my attention right away. It may be a bit of bias as this is coming from just after finishing Yasuke (overall a disappointment unfortunately), but the
          sound design in Mars Red just clicks. Everything feels right for the period the show is set in and for the moment its played in. It doesn't try to fit
          outlandish soundtracks into the series but opts for more accurate music that focus largely on traditional instruments featured in Japanese culture
          historically. Right from the opening moments of the episode the music used is excellent, it's a slower and more traditional version of the music that
          played with Misaki in the first episode as we open to Yamagami's wife quietly mourning as she knits in the empty house. Then of course, we're treated
          to the opening of the episode which has some excellent music as well.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Overall the majority of the music feels like something that should be offered by
          an orchestra, or if you're thinking the same way I am, a play in a theater. Once again Mars Red's heritage elevates its experience in anime as it doesn't
          go over the top with its soundtrack and mimic something of most modern shows thankfully. While it does reuse a lot of its soundtrack at different paces
          and keys and the like I haven't found it irksome or out of place in the slightest, mostly due to the excellent composition of the soundtrack that allows
          it to be so versatile and well used. Rather than create a large soundtrack similar to one like Jujutsu Kaisen's (though the JJK soundtrack is pretty
          amazing still!) it chooses quality over quantity, which also summarizes Mars Red as a whole pretty well. It opts for quality in all areas to create
          something incredibly satisfying instead of quantity that would string viewers along.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText">Some Well Needed Exposition</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          The third episode also acts to give us a large amount of information regarding the characters we've been following so far finally. While it's not <i>all</i>
          the information it definitely gives us a better look at who our cast is and their lives. Shutaro is shown at the start of the episode to be sleeping in a
          coffin in an empty room, which is quite comical due to the trope. We haven't seen the sleeping quarters of other vampires so it's unknown if it is actually
          necessary, a preference of Shutaro, or merely a joke that was played on him by the older vampires. I would think it to be one of the two latter options since
          we see Suwa and Defrott in beds in the opening and endings of the show. Moving on however we learn how Takeuchi became a vampire. With the aid of a flashback
          we see how the blood comes into contact with him, landing on his eye. In this scene alone there's lots of questions as it seems the vampire blood reacted to
          something which caused it to explode. Second is the fact that his "vampire mark" was on his eye where the blood made contact. You'd think it to be counterintuitive
          until you realize that Takeuichi became a vampire through a completely different method than the rest of Code Zero.
        </p>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          During his explanation while in the Tenmaya
          with Shutaro and Yamagami, Takeuchi also gives us some more information on the fake blood vampires are using, ascra. Apparently the blood contains the "V Virus",
          which can only be perceived as the piece of the puzzle that causes vampirism. However we don't learn any more about it as Takeuchi continues his ramble with
          referencing how old Suwa is, stating that he comes all the way from the Edo period (started around 1600). After Takeuchi is done weaving his words and explaining
          his reasoning for the excitement of being a vampire we're shown Suwa hanging out at the front of the theater, where he manages to cross paths with Defrott.
          Suwa verifies all theories we had about Defrott, as he calls him a monster just from the few moments they walked past each other. It's here that another theory
          arises as Defrott shares the same eye color as Suwa, where Takeuchi, Shutaro, and Yamagami have the more typical red eye color of a vampire. With that in mind
          it would make sense that Suwa and Defrott come from a similar age of vampires.

        <h3 class = "subTitleFit brightText"> The Military Machine </h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          Even though Mars Red takes place all the way back in the 1920s it has a pretty sharp commentary on the military and its ethics that fit well with the time period.
          Maeda reports to his superior for the day where the superior has to attempt to stand his ground against the rest of the high-ranking military generals in justifying
          his vampire unit. Appearances aside (there's a guy with the comically large mustache), the generals all take turns critiquing Nakajima and his vampire unit plan.
          They claim it hasn't produced any results and that vampires have a single glaring weakness and even mock Nakajima personally, commenting that "Nakajima's a hero
          who returned to a battlefield for just one of his men". During the commentary Maeda murmurs a line he regularly mentions to Code Zero, "Human hours, huh". A direct
          critique of the nature of the high-ranking military officials and their ideas of war and ethics. While the commentary is on a fictional branch of military in an
          era passed, the general ideas and comments still stand. Officials after money rather than peace, or even glory. A lack of interest in the people they send to fight.
          A general lack of humanity in their actions that's driven by things like money. Even though the show is based around an arms race for military strength in vampires
          their aversion to fighting and loss of life is shown time and time again. Both Nakajima and Maeda have the same thoughts, wanting to spare as many men as they can
          from the horrors of the fight. <h4 class = "brightText interjectTitle">"Still, bullets... I bet they've never experienced bullets whistling past their ears.".</h4>
        </p>
        <h3 class = "brightText subTitleFit">A Shakespearian Farewell</h3>
        <p class = "paragraphStyleOne mediumText paraIndent">
          In the episode a festival called "The Day of 46,000 Blessings" is happening where it's customary to release a lantern for a lost loved one. With that in
          mind Shutaro has the idea of introducing Yamagami as a ghost to his now widowed wife Tomiko, and plans to accomplish it by using his vampire powers. Once
          Shutaro places Yamagami in front of his wife she immediately believes it to be his ghost and a heart wrenching dialogue begins. The conversation they have
          revolves around sharing shakespeare-esque quotes with one another that aptly fit their conversation. If I was to break down this conversation as a whole I'd
          need an entire other post for how much is in it, but to make it short the meaning is most definitely there as Yamagami feels guilt for leaving his wife behind
          on her own. Tomiko however, feels incredibly grateful to have been given another chance to see her husband again. It's a very cathartic scene as Yamagami airs
          all his regrets to Tomiko and she gracefully absorbs them to give Yamagami the final farewell he never had the chance of. <h4 class ="interjectTitle brightText">"The person for whom I had waited
          anxiously had finally come; What can there be to regret in a meeting such as this?".</h4>
