          To make a long story short it's cause I have literally nothing better to do than build stuff, so I did.
          In actuality though, it was becuase I felt my university education in computer science was severely lacking
          for what is to be expected and assumed from a fresh graduate. I could have gone in dark into my career but
          I didn't want to be screwed from the start, so I began a search for projects to undertake. Website development has
          been my largest known weakpoint for a while now so I decided to get nice and personal with them to learn better. I also
          <i>really</i> like anime and always have so much to talk about with each episode so it made sense to combine the two so I
          don't get bored and to make sure I'm putting forward a solid effort.

          It's for anyone and everyone that enjoys anime and likes to hear about someone elses thoughts on it. The end goal is to create
          something that people are interested in visiting to get opinions, gush about an episode, and those sorts of things. The content
          that will be covered on here can definitely be explicit at times (violence, gore, etc.), so be warned for those things. There will
          not be, however, any explicitly sexual content covered on here. It might not be hentai but there are quite a few anime that definitely
          cross that line.

          Yes, I do. At the moment it consists of 2 (or 3, depending on how you define it), social media accounts. The primary account used being Twitter,
          it's perfect for posting small thoughts and blurbs, sharing images, and interacting with other people, if you haven't already clicked on one of the
          Twitter icons across the website heres a link to it: <a href = "https://twitter.com/Animehouse_Ca" target="_blank">twitter.com/Animehouse_Ca</a>. I
          also use Instagram though it's mostly for image posts from anime so it's not as consistent. You can find it here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/animehouse_ca/" target="_blank">instagram.com/animehouse_ca</a>.
          The last "social media" used is Discord. I have a Discord server dedicated to users interacting with the website or any of the social media accounts.
          It's definitely a more relaxed air with broader topics compared to here or Twitter. If you haven't noticed the large Discord embed in the sidebar by now
          and want to join the server, <a href="https://discord.gg/3ATNWRVxqb" target="_blank">click this highlighted text to join the server</a>. If you want to reach
          me directly the easiest way is to email me at "piroinquiry@gmail.com".

          There is literally zero correct answer to that question. Hell, I don't even have an answer to begin with. That's part of the reason that I'm doing this,
          I don't have a <i>singular favorite anime</i>, there's just too many with varying types, animation, voice actors, art, stories. There's just too much of everything
          to be able to narrow it down to a single pick. Plus, I feel, when you find that quintessential show the fun is over. Once you've found the best you're admitting that
          nothing else can top it, nothing else could change your mind. So as long as I'm still interested in anime I definitely won't have a singular favorite anime, I'll have one hell
          of a watch list to recommend though.
